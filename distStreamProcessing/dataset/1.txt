1 On 18 November 2005 I published reasons for judgment in this proceeding; see Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing &amp; Allied Services Union of Australia v ACI Operations Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1662.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">On that day the Court ordered the reinstatement of Mr Colin Williams and deferred consideration of penalty and compensation pending the receipt of written submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">These reasons for judgment should be read together with the reasons for judgment published on 18 November 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">Penalty 
 
2 The following observations made in the previous judgment are relevant to penalty:
 
 &#8226; Mr Pillen's refusal to accept the existence of a dispute; [16]
 &#8226; The decision to conduct the stop work meeting at the time it was held arose from Mr Pillen's refusal to acknowledge the existence of a dispute; [17]
 &#8226; It would have been more appropriate, notwithstanding the above point, to hold the meeting at lunchtime; [53]
 &#8226; The "overbearing and provocative" manner in which Mr Minniti spoke to Mr Williams; [24]
 &#8226; The different treatment accorded to other employees who had taken strike action but were not disciplined; [29], [43]
 &#8226; The failure to engage the disciplinary code suggested strongly that Mr Gillholme and Mr Minniti were keen to be rid of Mr Williams; [37]
 &#8226; That Mr Williams' status as team coordinator did not affect the decision to terminate him; [38], [43]
 &#8226; The breach of s 298K of the Act was blatant and serious; [51], [71]
 &#8226; "ACI desired to be rid of Mr Williams, who it saw as an active shop steward ... who had given it some grief on industrial issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">" [52] 

3 Counsel for ACI submitted that the decision to terminate Mr Williams was made in response to what Mr Gillholme and Mr Minniti understood was Mr Williams' conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">Counsel also contended that it was action which Mr Gillholme and Mr Minniti believed they were entitled to take under the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The decision was opportunistic and not premeditated, counsel submitted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">4 Even if it is accepted that the decision was an opportunistic one, it was nonetheless unlawful and, in the circumstances set out in the previous judgment, it constituted a blatant and serious breach of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">I do not accept the submission that the termination of Mr Williams flowed from a failure to appreciate the scope of s 298L(1)(a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">Mr Gillholme and Mr Minniti are both experienced in industrial relations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">They should not have been in any doubt about the illegality of their conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">5 I reject the contention that Mr Minniti's reaction to Mr Williams' putting the telephone down showed that Mr Minniti was merely reacting to provocation rather than acting in deliberate defiance of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Mr Minniti had the opportunity to put a considered recommendation to Mr Gillholme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The recommendation was not a spur of the moment decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">6 Mr Williams' failure to hold the meeting at lunchtime should be considered as only a minor mitigating factor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">To class it as a major mitigating factor would reward Mr Pillen's even more inappropriate conduct in failing to accept the existence of a dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">7 I further reject the submission that Mr Williams' status as team co-ordinator was "an ameliorating circumstance".</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">Such a contention is inconsistent with the reasons for judgment of 18 November 2005, in which the Court found that Mr Williams' status as a team coordinator was not a basis for his termination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">8 I agree with the submission of counsel for ACI that the Court should not take into account the breach of the disciplinary code, in itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">However, as counsel for the Union submitted, adherence to the code may have avoided the situation which ACI now finds itself in as a result of its summary dismissal of Mr Williams.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">9 An examination of the relevant facts shows that two senior industrial relations managers, in important roles, made a decision to terminate the employment of an active shop steward, whose industrial representation of the members of the Union working at ACI had displeased them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">In the circumstances, a penalty in the high range of those available is appropriate, but for the matters set out below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">10 I now turn to the other factors relevant to the question of penalty as discussed by Branson J in Construction, Forestry, Mining &amp; Energy Union v Coal &amp; Allied Operations Pty Ltd (No 2) (1999) 94 IR 231, as foreshadowed at [79] in the previous judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">11 There is no evidence that ACI has previously contravened Pt XA of the Act, or any predecessor provision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">That is a mitigating factor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">12 Given that Mr Williams has been reinstated and that ACI has been admonished for its conduct in the 18 November 2005 judgment, there are no continuing consequences in respect of ACI's conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">13 The protection of industrial freedom of association and, in this case, freedom of representation, has been upheld by the reinstatement order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">14 The maximum penalty available to the Court is 300 penalty units or $33,000, see s 298U(a)(i) of the Act and s 4AA(1) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">15 Having regard to the totality of the above matters I consider that a mid-range penalty is appropriate and set the penalty at $16,500.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">16 There is no reason why the penalty should not be paid to the Union; see Finance Section Union v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [2005] FCA 1847 at [71] , per Merkel J and s 356(b) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Compensation 
 
17 The Union does not currently press for an order for the payment of compensation to Mr Williams.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">Counsel for the Union informed the Court that ACI has, since 18 November 2005, agreed to make adjustments necessary to ensure Mr Williams' financial position is restored.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">However, counsel noted that the agreement between the parties had not been fully implemented and submitted that the Court should defer consideration of compensation to allow the agreement to be implemented.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">18 It is preferable to allow sufficient time to elapse to permit the parties' agreement to take effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">I will place the onus on the Union to re-agitate this issue within 28 days of these reasons for judgment, failing which there will be no order made under s 298U(c) concerning compensation and the file will be closed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">Should the Union wish to re-agitate this issue the Court will convene a directions hearing at 10.15 am on 14 March 2005 to deal with that aspect of this proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">Orders 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">Pursuant to s 298U(a)(i) of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) a penalty of $16,500 be imposed on the respondent for its contravention of s 298K(1)(a) of the Act for the prohibited reason referred to in s 298L(1)(a) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">

2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">Pursuant to s 356(b) of the Act the penalty be paid to the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">The applicant have liberty to apply to the Court within 28 days of the date of this order, for an order requiring the respondent to pay to Mr Colin Williams an amount by way of compensation as the Court thinks appropriate.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">4.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">In the event of liberty to apply under Order 3 not being availed of in the time permitted, the Court will make no order for compensation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">

<sentence id="s0">
 The circumstances of the applicants to the present dispute and the nature and implications of their business and operational activities relevant thereto 
 
1 The first applicant, WorldAudio Limited ('WAL'), is a public company listed on the Australian Stock Exchange, having approximately 1200 ordinary shareholders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">Its principal business is the sale of broadcast airtime to advertisers, per medium of commercial radio broadcasting services, at some 50 locations around Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The second applicant AusCoast Broadcasting Pty Limited ('AusCoast') is a wholly owned subsidiary of WAL and has been since February 2002, when WAL acquired the total AusCoast shareholding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">AusCoast holds a Medium Frequency Narrowband Area Service ('MF NAS') radiocommunications apparatus licence issued under s 100(1) of the Radiocommunications Act 1992 (Cth) ('the Act'), being licence number 1130030 (the '1620 licence').</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Broadly speaking, it is in the nature of a transmitter licence , in contrast to a receiver licence , those being the two types of apparatus licence available under s 97 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">In turn, there are several types of transmitter licences provided for by the Act, the 1620 licence being described by the applicants as 'a broadcasting license type'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">A ' broadcasting station ' is defined by s 5 of the Act to mean:
 
 'a transmitter that is operating for the purposes of: 
 
 
 (a) a broadcasting services bands licence; or 
 (b) the provision of a national broadcasting service within the meaning of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (Cth)'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">
 
 
 

2 WorldAudio Communications Pty Limited ('the Broadcaster'), being a further subsidiary of WAL, holds an Australia-wide commercial radio broadcasting licence under s 40 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (Cth), being licence No 1170227.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">That legislation does not fall for scrutiny in the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The broadcasting services of the Broadcaster are presently transmitted in the Brisbane area by AusCoast under the auspices of the 1620 licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">For convenience, and in line with the applicants' written submissions, those services transmitted in the Brisbane area are hereafter referred to as 'the broadcasting service'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">An independent engineering report prepared for WAL by THL Australia Pty Ltd, said by the applicants to be one of Asia Pacific's leading broadcast engineering groups, was to the effect that the 1620 licence provides a signal of 'superior listening quality' to 1,150,065 persons in the Brisbane area, and of so-called 'acceptable listening quality' to a further 882,596 persons in the Brisbane area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">3 The statutory scheme for licensing the use of spectrum under the Act has been administered by the respondent Australian Communications and Media Authority ('the Authority' or 'ACMA'), and its precursor the Australian Communications Authority, since 1 July 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Prior to that time, the administration of licensing was undertaken by the Spectrum Management Agency.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">Nothing turns however on those changes in identity of the administering authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The statutory scheme contains provisions, in addition to the issue of apparatus licences, in relation to the duration of apparatus licences (s 103), the general conditions of apparatus licences (s 107), additional conditions of apparatus licences (s 108), changes to conditions of apparatus licences (s 111), the making of guidelines that the Authority is to apply in exercising its powers under sections 107, 108 and 111 (s 112), the suspension or cancellation of apparatus licences (ss 126 and 128 ), the renewal of apparatus licences (s 130) , and the transfer of apparatus licences (ss 131AA and 131AB).</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">4 One of the conditions of the 1620 licence, apparently imposed from the time of its first issue, is that the location of the transmitter be 170 Kingsley Terrace, Manly, being a suburb of Brisbane; that site was referred to in the course of the proceedings as the 'condition site'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">That condition was imposed pursuant to s 107(1)(g) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Other conditions relate to various technical aspects of the radiocommunications transmission authorised by the licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">In spite of that condition, transmission of the broadcasting service has never occurred in any physically operative sense from that site at Manly, that is, from the condition site, at least for the reason that the condition site is located within an established residential area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The broadcasting service is presently transmitted from a different location in the Brisbane area, being 320 Fleming Road, Tingalpa, which is 5.7 kilometres distant from the condition site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">That site at Tingalpa is sometimes referred to in the parties' submissions as the 'current site', in contrast to the 'condition site' at Manly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">The effect of the purported decision of the respondent Authority, the subject of the present review application, which was made on 30 June 2005 and affirmed on 18 August 2005, is that AusCoast is not officially authorised to transmit the broadcasting service, or any other radiocommunications service, from the current site, without breaching the locational condition of the 1620 licence referrable to Manly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">That prohibition, if enforced, would apparently mean that the broadcasting service of the Broadcaster must cease to be transmitted in the Brisbane metropolitan area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">So much would occasion substantial loss and damage, both directly and indirectly, as the applicants understandably emphasised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">5 As I have already indicated, there is not, nor has there ever been, any radiocommunications transmitter located at the condition site at Manly, that site being located within a residential area of Brisbane and itself comprising residential premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">When application was originally made by AusCoast for the 1620 licence, it appears that the condition site at Manly was used by AusCoast as the nominal location site for the 1620 licence because of an inability of AusCoast to identify a suitable location elsewhere for transmission of its broadcasting service to Brisbane, pending proper planning for transmission of radio communications under that licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">The adoption of that course of purported expediency was said by Mr Thompson, the chief executive officer of WAL, to accord with the then practice of administrative convenience in operation at that time in respect of applications for and adoption of transmitter licences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">As I have foreshadowed, that practice was said to allow an applicant for a MF NAS apparatus licence to identify a convenient address for the transmission site referrable to the applicant's licence, pending completion of comprehensive planning for transmission of radiocommunications under the licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">In fact an application appears to have been made by AusCoast for the change of the transmission site from Manly to another site in the Brisbane locality as far back as 12 November 1996, it being doubtless considered that it would be highly unlikely that the necessary town planning approval could ever be obtained to operate the 1620 licence from within the Manly residential area, owing to the environmental implications that might have ensued to an area of land so zoned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">A precedent for that practice was identified by the applicants as the MF NAS apparatus licence for Hobart, which was listed nominally by reference to the site of the Hobart Fire Station, even though such location could not constitute a radiocommunications site in any operational physical sense for radio interference reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">6 On 29 August 2003, the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (the 'Minister') issued Australian Communication Authority Direction (MF NAS Transmitter Licences) Direction No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">1 of 2003, the practical effect of which was contended by the applicants to be that the holders of MF NAS apparatus licences, such as AusCoast, would not be permitted to transmit a commercial radio broadcasting service under a licence of that designation, unless the service was provided by 29 August 2004 (ie within one year later).</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">7 AusCoast commenced transmission of the subject broadcasting service on 5 November 2003 from the current site at 320 Fleming Street, Tingalpa, in alleged satisfaction of the Minister's direction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">It appears that the transmission of the subject broadcasting service of AusCoast has thereafter continued unabated from the Tingalpa site, and there further appears to have been no complaint communicated to any of the parties to the proceedings, including the Authority, as to AusCoast's transmission of its broadcasting service from the Tingalpa site having caused any interference to any other radiocommunication transmission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">8 It was the applicants' further case that the current site is an established radiocommunications transmission site, and that its utilisation by AusCoast for that purpose has complied with all relevant town planning, local government and environmental laws, whereas the condition site remains as I have already indicated within a residential area, in relation to which it is highly unlikely any corresponding requisite approvals could ever be obtained in relation thereto; for one matter, there is a block of residential units standing in the immediate vicinity of the Manly transmission site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">It was therefore that on 6 August 2004, AusCoast applied to the then relevant authority to change the site condition of the 1620 licence from its nominal location in Manly to its operative broadcasting site at Tingalpa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">In the course of the communications which ensued, the Authority alleged that the broadcasting service being provided, in effect under the auspices of the 1620 licence, was being operated in breach of licence conditions, by virtue of transmission occurring from a site otherwise than that stated in the condition to the licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">9 On receipt of that application of 6 August 2004, the Authority responded by fax of 16 August 2004 to the effect that any such variation of the site condition in respect of the 1620 licence was not acceptable, for the reason that it '... would put the station closer to an adjacent [channel] service on 1611kHz at Tingalpa and less than 30km from an adjacent channel service on 1629kHz at Mango Hill ... [and the transmission site] would be closer to a co-channel service at Toowoomba.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">' Of course there existed a degree of artificiality in relation to the expression '... place the transmitter closer...', the placement of the transmitter apparatus being already physically located at Tingalpa, and having never been physically located at Manly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">10 I should perhaps incorporate reference to further terminologies, practices and policies appearing in the evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">A 'co-channel service' is another service broadcasting at the same frequency whereas an 'adjacent channel service' would be one broadcasting at either of the two frequencies each side of the subject apparatus licence, namely 1611 kHz and 1629 kHz in the present circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">The use of the expression 'closer' by the Authority's officer in the fax of 16 August 2005 is a reference to the application of the so-called '30/160 rule' which rule is enumerated in two policy documents of the Authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">The first document is a 'Business Operating Procedure' entitled 'Licensing Narrowband Area Service stations' ('NAS BOP') and the second document is a 'policy information paper' entitled 'Apparatus Licensing --- Narrowband Area Service stations' ('NAS PIP').</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">In effect, those policies stipulate a minimum separation distance between MF NAS transmitters on co-channel frequencies of 160 kilometres and for adjacent channels of 30 kilometres.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">Since in the past the enforcement of those minimum separation distances has not always been strict on the part of the Authority (or its predecessors), it has also formulated the 'make it better rule', whereby suggested variations in site location that do not satisfy the '30/160 rule', but which are an improvement on the status quo in terms of the distances between transmission services, may be approved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">11 Subsequently by letter dated 5 October 2004 a further Authority communication informed WAL inter alia that its application dated 6 August 2004 to relocate the 1620 licence had 'not been finalised' because '... the site co-ordinates that you provided do not meet, or improve, co-channel separation distances'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">Interestingly in the light of the Authority's present submissions, the author of the letter then went on to request 'within one month of today, additional site co-ordinates information and/or details of how [WAL] propose to regularise the operation of [the 1620 licence]', and said that 'this correspondence is to be taken as a request for additional information for the purposes of s 286 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">' That requested information was apparently provided to the Authority by WAL in a letter dated 27 October 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">By letter of 15 November 2004, the Authority acknowledged WAL's ongoing efforts to resolve its site difficulties, but indicated nevertheless that the broadcasting service was operating 'in breach of licence conditions'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">No express mention was apparently made in that correspondence of 15 November 2004 to WAL's 'application...to relocate [the 1620 licence]', as that application was described in the Authority's earlier letter of 5 October 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">12 Two file notes authored by respective officers of the Authority evidence telephone discussions apparently undertaken by those same officers of the Authority with Mr Thompson of WAL in late 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">In both of those file notes, the Authority's officers claim to have impressed upon Mr Thompson that the Authority 'had already considered the matter [of the variation of the site condition on the 1620 licence]' and had 'arrived at its current position'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">On the second occasion Mr Thompson was apparently invited to make another request in writing, which he duly did by letter dated 13 December 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">That letter sought both the relocation of the 1620 licence to the Tingalpa site but also the revocation of MF NAS apparatus licence number 1402943 ('the 1611 licence'), which had as its site condition a location also in Tingalpa some 7.5 kilometres away from AusCoast's current transmission site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">13 At this point of the narrative of material circumstances, I would revert back in time to 27 February 1996, being some five months after the issue originally of the 1620 licence to AusCoast.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">At that time in 1996, so the applicants pointed out, the 1611 licence was registered in the name of Queensland Hospital Radio Association.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">The site of the 1611 licence shown in records maintained by the Authority is presently recorded as Bracken Ridge Reservoir.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">Until January 2005, the 1611 licence, that being of course to be distinguished from the applicants' 1620 licence, had a different site location, recorded as being in Tingalpa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">However by about the commencement of 2005, a change to the present 1611 licence site at Bracken Ridge Reservoir was approved by the Authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">The Bracken Ridge Reservoir site is 21063 kilometres distant from the condition site at Manly, and 18.291 kilometres distant from the current site at Tingalpa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">Yet the 1611 licence is inoperative and has never operated, so the applicants maintained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">Those circumstances were raised by the applicants by way of apparent exemplification of at least the alleged elasticity of administration and operation of the Act relevantly to the nomination of site locations of licensees for convenience until an appropriate transmitter site can be found.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">The fact that the 1611 licence had issued some five months after the 1620 licence was said to be explanatory of the request made by WAL to the Authority for the revocation of the 1611 licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">That request, and the events occasioning it, are not of course directly relevant to the present proceedings, but provides potentially relevant background to the principal case of the applicants to be presented, in the event that the applicants are successful in the present interlocutory dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">14 Further discussions and communications have ensued between WAL and the Authority concerning the possibility of AusCoast continuing to transmit from Tingalpa, in circumstances which nevertheless were described on behalf of the Authority as already involving breach of licence conditions, though pending resolution of what an officer of the Authority described as AusCoast's attempts to acquire another licence located at Tingalpa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">By letter dated 23 December 2004, the Authority purported to 'reiterate its advice to [WAL] of 26 August 2004 that [the Tingalpa site] is unsuitable because it does not meet co-channel or adjacent channel re-use distances for a number of services...'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">Next followed a description of the respective services which were said by the Authority to render the request for variation of the site location to involve breach of the Authority's policy on technical requirements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">There followed on 14 February 2005 a written request from WAL's solicitors to the Authority to make a decision under s 111 of the Act concerning a condition of the 1620 licence, being that the site of that licence be changed from Manly to Tingalpa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">Critical to the present proceedings is the Authority's correspondence of 30 June 2005, which, after describing the relevant policies and expressing the effect of the proposed relocation on separation distances between the transmission under the 1620 licence and those nearby, was relevantly in the following terms:
 
 '...the [Authority] will not exercise its discretionary power under section 111 of the [Act] and vary the licence conditions in the terms proposed by [WAL]... 
 
 [S]ection 111 confers a power on the [Authority] to unilaterally impose, revoke or vary licence conditions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">In this way, the only "decision" contemplated by the section is one that will some way change the licence conditions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">If there is no change to the licence conditions, then for section 111 purposes, no decision has been made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">It follows from this that it is only where the [Authority] decides to impose, revoke or vary conditions that a review can be sought under the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">
 
 In this case the [Authority] has not made a decision to change the licence conditions so a reviewable decision has not been made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">' 
 

The first issue arising in the present interlocutory dispute is whether that communication was a decision ... made... under an enactment for the purposes of s 3(1) of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) ('ADJR Act').</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">It is that issue which is addressed by these reasons for judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">
 

15 WAL subsequently requested reconsideration of the Authority's refusal to vary the licence site condition, doing so purportedly pursuant to s 285(g) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">WAL also sought from the Authority a statement of its reasons for decision pursuant to s 13 of the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">Both of those requests were refused by the Authority in correspondence of 18 August 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">In that correspondence, the Authority reiterated its view that 
 
 '...section 111 of the Act confers a power on [the Authority] to impose, revoke or vary licence conditions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">[The Authority] has not exercised its power under section 111 to impose, revoke or vary licence conditions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">There is therefore no decision under the Act for [the Authority] to reconsider under section 285 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">' 

In respect of WAL's request for a statement of reasons, the Authority said:
 
 'the decision not to vary the licence condition of [the 1620 licence] is not a decision made under the [Act].</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">The [ADJR Act] applies to decisions made under an enactment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">As there has not been any such decision, this request for a statement of reasons is refused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">' 
 

16 It is further in issue in the present interlocutory proceedings whether the Authority's refusal to reconsider its decision pursuant to s 285 of the Act, and to provide a statement of reasons for its decision of 30 June 2005, amounted to decision[s] ... made ... under an enactment for the purposes of the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">The applicants' reasons for the intervention of curial relief and the nature of the relief sought 
 
17 It is largely in the context I have already described that what the applicants contend to have been the primary decision of the Authority made adversely to the applicants on 30 June 2005, being a decision followed by the Authority's subsequent refusal to reconsider that earlier decision pursuant to s 285(g) of the Act, or to provide reasons for it, have become the subject of an application for review under both the ADJR Act, and contemporaneously also under s 39B(1A) of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) (' Judiciary Act ').</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">The applicants' apprehension is that the practical effect of the decisions of the Authority under review is that their present broadcasting service under the auspices of the 1620 licence must cease to be provided to the Brisbane area, there being apparently no other means by which the applicants could cause their subject broadcasting service to be transmitted to the numbers of persons in that area presently reached.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">The implications of any such outcome are apparently considered to be as damaging as they are far reaching to the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">18 The applicants' case was that the maintenance of the status quo in relation to the 1620 licence, is vital to WAL's business involving the sale of broadcast airtime to advertisers, and further that the metropolitan area of Brisbane, as the capital city of Queensland, is a vital part of WAL's radio network.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">The provision of the subject broadcasting service under the 1620 licence is a key source of the advertising revenue of WAL.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">That is because when allocating advertising to radio networks, advertising agencies place significant weight on the ability of a network to reach audiences in the three major Eastern seaboard capital cities of Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">Accordingly if WAL is unable to continue to provide a radio network which covers each of those cities, it will be seriously disadvantaged financially when competing in the national radio market, being a market presently embracing at least those three capital cities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">It was asserted that WAL's reputation as a reliable provider of national commercial radio would therefore also be greatly damaged, with a consequentially adverse impact on all remaining markets in which it presently operates, and therefore on its revenues, share price and returns to shareholders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">19 The Authority's decision primarily the subject of the present application for review, as I have foreshadowed, was communicated to the applicants by letter dated 30 June 2005, being a decision by the Authority not to vary a condition of the 1620 licence by providing that instead of the site of transmission remaining nominally at 170 Kingsley Terrace, Manly, the current site of actual transmission at 320 Fleming Road, Tingalpa be authorised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">That nominated site relocation was not entertained because it was said not to meet the Authority's policy relating to separation distances between transmitters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">That refusal of site relocation decision, according to the applicants, was made pursuant to s 111 of the Act; however the Authority did not so characterise the same, and hence the Authority did not issue a s 287 notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">20 Included within the challenge of that decision of 30 June 2005, and hence the subject further of the present administrative review proceedings, are also what the applicants term the Authority's subsequent decisions, each made on 18 August 2005, being not to reconsider its first decision pursuant to s 285(g) of the Act, and also to refuse WAL's request for a statement of reasons for that first decision pursuant to s 13 of the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">The Authority adopted the position that no decision the subject of challenge had been made by it under an enactment, notwithstanding, as the applicants would insist, that a decision of the Authority exercising the discretion conferred by s 111 of the Act would constitute such a decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">21 The basis provided by the applicants in their amended application for being 'aggrieved' by the three respective decisions referred to above, within the meaning of s 5(1) of the ADJR Act, were outlined as follows: 
 
 
 (i) AusCoast is a wholly owned subsidiary of WAL and the holder of the 1620 licence; 
 
 
 
 
 
 (ii) by letter dated 14 February 2005, WAL requested that the site of the 1620 licence be changed from the Manly site to the Tingalpa site; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 (iii) the Authority 'claims that no decision has been made under an enactment and has refused to reconsider the First Decision [ie communicated on 30 June 2005] or to provide a statement of reasons as sought by [WAL].</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">' 
 
 
 

22 The grounds for the applicants' review application were fourfold as follows:
 
 
 (i) the first decision of the Authority on 30 June 2005 involved one or more errors of law, in that: 
 

(a) the Authority misconstrued the NAS PIP Policy (being the policy embodying the so-called '30/160 rule' and the 'make it better rule') by applying the same as if it had the force of law; 
 
(b) the first decision was made in accordance with that policy, being a published policy of the Authority, and was based primarily on the reduction in distance between another radiocommunications transmission site at Mango Hill (apparently conducted by Proma Radio) and the Tingalpa site from 30.7 kilometres to 29.6 kilometres; so much was said by the applicants to involve 'an overly rigid application of the policy, which is a policy and not a statutory rule';
 
 
 (ii) the making of the first decision on 30 June 2005 was an improper exercise of the power conferred by s 111 of the Act, in pursuance of which it was purported to be made, in that: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) the Authority failed to take relevant considerations into account in the exercise of the power, namely the considerations set out in WAL's request for the site of the licence to be changed from Manly to Tingalpa; 
 (b) the Authority exercised its discretionary power in accordance with a rule of policy without regard to the merits of the particular case; 
 
 
 
 
 (iii) the second decision, being the Authority's refusal to reconsider its decision of 30 June 2005, involved an error of law, in that the Authority misconstrued ss 111, 285(f) and 285(g) of the Act;
 (iv) the third decision involved an error of law, in that having regard to the proper construction of ss 111, 285(f) and 285(g) of the Act, the Authority was obliged under s 13 of the ADJR Act to provide WAL with a statement of reasons under that provision in respect of the first decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">
 

23 Those above respective provisions of the Act (of course being the Radiocommunications Act 1992 (Cth) earlier referred to) read, so far as presently material, as follows:
 
 '111 Changes to licence conditions 
 
 
 
 (i) The ACMA may, by notice in writing given to the licensee of an apparatus licence: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) impose one or more further conditions to which the licence is subject; or 
 
 
 
 
 (b) revoke or vary any condition imposed under paragraph (a); or 
 
 
 
 
 
 (c) revoke or vary any condition specified under paragraph 107(1)(g) ... 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (d) if the licence is a transmitter licence, other than a licence issued under section 101A , 102 or 102A or a datacasting transmitter licence --- vary a condition of the kind referred to in paragraph 108(2)(a), (b) or (c).</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">' 
 
 
 
 

(I would mention that s 107 relates to general conditions of an apparatus licence, s 108 to additional conditions for transmitter licences, and ss 101A , 102 and 102A to transmitter licences for particular broadcasting services).</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">
 
 '285 Decisions that may be subject to reconsideration by the ACMA 
 
 
 
 An application may be made to the ACMA for reconsideration of any of the following decisions: 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 
 
 (f) inclusion of conditions in an apparatus licence under paragraph 107 (1)(g) ...; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (g) a decision under section 111 concerning the conditions of an apparatus licence;'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">
 
 
 
 

24 It is appropriate to set out also the text of paragraphs 107(1)(a), (f) and (g):
 
 '107 General conditions 
 
 
 
 (1) An apparatus licence is subject to the following conditions: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) a condition that the licensee, and any person authorised by the licensee to operate a radiocommunications device under the licence, must comply with this Act; 
 
 ... 
 
 (f) such conditions (if any) as the ACMA may determine, by written instrument, in relation to that particular type of apparatus licence; 
 
 (g) such other conditions as are specified in the licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">
 
 ...' 
 
 The Authority's objections to competency and the applicants' contentions in support of competency 
 
25 On 31 August 2005, the Authority filed an amended notice of objection to competency which asserted that the Court lacked jurisdiction to try the application for review brought under the ADJR Act and under s 39B(1A) of the Judiciary Act , on the grounds that the decision purportedly the subject of the proceedings is not a decision made under an enactment nor a matter arising under any laws made by the Parliament.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">The amended notice of objection to competency went on to state '[i]n the alternative if the court determines that it has jurisdiction there is no proper basis upon which to grant relief to the applicant[s]'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">The Authority described this as its 'related alternative motion'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">26 As I have foreshadowed, in support of its objection to competency, in relation to the operation of the ADJR Act in the present circumstances outlined by the applicants, the Authority characterised its decision of 30 June 2005 adversely to the applicants, not as a decision to refuse to change the subject site condition for the 1620 licence of the applicants, but rather as a prior decision to decline to consider whether or not the site condition may be varied at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">It was largely upon that footing that the Authority contended that the initial or prior decision of 30 June 2005 was not a decision made under an enactment, even though a decision involving the exercise of the discretion conferred by s 111 of the Act would seemingly constitute such a decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">The applicants rejoined to the effect that even if that purported distinction was to be taken at face value, the very notion that any such so-called initial or prior decision did not constitute a decision made under the Act immediately encounters forensic and conceptual difficulties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">The Authority also submitted that the lawfulness of such initial or prior decision was not a ' matter ... arising under any laws made by the Parliament ...' (see s 39B(1A) of the Judiciary Act ), since it was made under a non-legislative policy, being the subject of the NAS PIP and NAS BOP policy documents referred to above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">27 The meaning and implications of the statutory notion of 'decision', where used in the ADJR Act, was comprehensively explained by the High Court in Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">It was emphasised by Mason CJ at 335 (with whose reasons Brennan J agreed, as did Deane J other than in relation to a particular matter not here material) that such meaning must be determined by reference to the text, scope and purpose of the legislation, and further that the remedial nature of the ADJR Act indicates that no narrow view is to be taken of the notion of 'decision' in that statutory context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">Moreover his Honour pointed out at 336 that the concept of 'a reviewable decision is a decision which a statute requires or authorises, rather than merely a step taken in the course of reasoning on the way to the making of the ultimate decision', and further that 'the examples of a decision listed in the extended definition contained in s 3(2) [of the ADJR Act] are also indicative of a decision having the character or quality of finality, [being] an outcome reflecting something in the nature of a determination of an application, inquiry or dispute ...'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">Section 3(3) of the ADJR Act, which extends the statutory definition of 'decision' to '... the making of a report or recommendation before a decision is made in the exercise of a power ', was said by his Honour to operate to '... qualif[y] the characteristic of finality'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">Moreover the Chief Justice explained that '... acts done preparatory to the making of a "decision" are not to be regarded as constituting "decisions" for, if they were, there would be little, if any, point in providing for judicial review of "conduct" as well as of a "decision".</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">'
 
28 In the further course of his reasons for judgment in Bond at 337, Mason CJ pointed out that '... a reviewable "decision" is one for which provision is made by or under a statute', which '... will generally, but not always, entail a decision which is final or operative and determinative, at least in a practical sense, of the issue of fact falling for consideration', so long of course '... that it be a substantive determination', as opposed to 'procedural determinations'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">29 The applicants focused those explanations and expositions of the Chief Justice upon s 111 of the Act, which refers to power conferred upon the Authority inter alia to revoke or vary any condition of a licence which it may have previously imposed, and submitted that so much did not mean that a refusal to exercise any such positive power on the part of the Authority did not constitute a decision made under s 111.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">It was pointed out in that regard, in my opinion rightly, that there are many statutes in which the decision-making power is expressed only in terms of a positive discretion, without express reference to the power to make a decision of a negative character, yet in such cases it is necessarily implicit that a negative decision would also be made under that provision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">Otherwise, so it was further emphasised by the present applicants, paras (a), (b) and (g) of s 3(2) of the ADJR Act would be otiose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">Those subsections read as follows (the emphasis appearing in non-italics is mine):
 
 's 3(2) In this Act, a reference to the making of a decision includes a reference to: 
 
 
 
 (a) making, suspending, revoking or refusing to make an order, award or determination; 
 (b) giving, suspending, revoking or refusing to give a certificate, direction, approval, consent or permission; 
 
 
 ... 
 (g) doing or refusing to do any other act or thing...' 
 

30 In that context of the applicants' discussion of general principles and their operation, I was then referred to the decision of a Full Federal Court in Right to Life Association (NSW) Inc v Secretary, Department of Human Services and Health (1995) 56 FCR 50, where it was held by Lockhart and Beaumont JJ that a decision by the Secretary not to direct that clinical trials of a drug be stopped was a reviewable decision for the purposes of the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">The provision in issue was item 3(e) of Schedule 5A of the Therapeutic Goods Regulations 1990 (Cth), that item being one of a number of conditions to be satisfied for exemption of the drug from the operation of Part 3 of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 (Cth), which condition read as follows:
 
 '(e) the Secretary must not, at any time: 
 
 
 
 
 (i) have become aware that to conduct or continue the trial would be contrary to the public interest; and 
 
 (ii) have directed that the trial not be conducted, or be stopped ...'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">
 
 
 

The appellant Association had requested the Secretary to stop the trials on the ground that they amounted to a breach of NSW and Victorian criminal law, and were thus ' contrary to the public interest '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">The Secretary had then notified the appellant Association and advised that on the evidence available, 'nothing would warrant my acting to stop the trials'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">At 62, Lockhart J observed in relation to that notification as follows:
 
 
 'If the Secretary has reached the opposite conclusion, namely, that to continue the trials would be contrary to the public interest and that a direction should be given to stop them, and thereupon gave that direction, surely that must be a reviewable decision under the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">The sponsor [of the trial] would clearly be a person aggrieved and would in my view be entitled to such a review of the decision under the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">Why should the position be different if the Secretary reaches the opposite conclusion, as he did in this case ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">It was a decision which had "the character or quality of finality"; it was an ultimate or operative decision ...' 
 

Beaumont J, who reached the same decision as Lockhart J, pointed out at 80 that '... the definition of "decision" in s 3(1) of the ADJR Act is not confined to those cases where a duty to make a decision is imposed ...'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">Although he reached a different outcome to the majority, Gummow J's observations at 88 are I think also apposite for consideration in the present circumstances:
 
 
 'It was submitted for the Secretary that s 5(1) of the ADJR Act would be attracted only if conferral of the power to give the direction carried with it a duty upon the Secretary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">It was then submitted that in the case of condition (e) there was no such duty ... 
 
 The submission, in essence, would limit the operation of s 5 of the ADJR Act to decisions in respect of which there was a public duty, performance of which might be required by a writ of mandamus ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">This would be contrary to the scheme of the legislation ...' 
 

31 The Authority sought to deny any conclusion as to the existence of a justiciable decision by characterising its first decision as declining to even consider the exercise of any discretion under s 111 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">In the applicants' submission that purported characterisation was misconceived, and must be rejected, for the following reasons:
 
 
 (i) the decision not to exercise its power under s 111 to vary a condition of the licence was indeed final, operative and determinative, in the practical sense described in Bond and in Right to Life [cedilla] of AusCoast's ability to continue to broadcast under the auspices of the 1620 licence from the current site at Tingalpa;
 
 (ii) any such characterisation sits at least uncomfortably with the terms of the Authority's letter of 30 June 2005, containing as it does the assertion '[a]s a result the [Authority] will not exercise its discretionary power under section 111 of the [Act] and vary licence conditions in the terms proposed by [WAL]'; 
 
 
 
 
 
 (iii) the decision not to exercise the power was one which was authorised by and therefore made under s 111 of the Act, since s 111 confers a discretionary power, and hence contemplates that a decision whether or not to exercise that discretion could be made, there being no other source of power for such a decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">
 
 
 

I think that there is force in each of the foregoing submissions of the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">
 

32 The Authority did not dispute that a refusal to exercise a power may constitute a decision...made...under an enactment , for the purposes of the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">Nevertheless it sought to distinguish Right to Life on the basis that in the circumstances of that case, as opposed to the present case, the decision-maker had purported to consider 'the full gamut...of all the relevant issues'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">The Authority's contention was that its officer in this instance had in effect 'terminated the request [made by WAL for a variation in the site condition of the 1620 licence] at the first hurdle', without considering all of the issues that the Authority would normally take into account in assessing a variation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">I am not persuaded that such contention of the Authority is sound, and that there is in any event any viable difference between the circumstances relevantly in Right to Life and those here prevailing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">In both instances the decision-maker received a request for a decision to be made to a certain effect, and in both instances there was no provision made under the relevant legislation for such requests to be made by formal application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">Moreover in both cases, detailed reasons for that request were given by the entity in favour of the decision it sought to be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">Most importantly for the outcome of this objection to competency, it was put by the applicants that the refusal of the Authority to make a decision in the terms requested by WAL had the practical effect of constituting an ultimate or operative decision, and hence one which bore the character of finality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">The applicants' contentions in relation to what it termed the Authority's second decision made on 18 August 2005 
 
33 It becomes necessary to consider next the implications of the Authority's so-called 'second decision', being that said by the applicants to have been made on 18 August 2005 not to reconsider its first decision of 30 June 2005, to the effect that it would not exercise its discretionary statutory power to alter the condition on the 1620 licence so as to change the site of the licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">The Authority's objection to the Court's competency to review the second decision rested however on its objection to competency of review of the first decision, and was therefore said by the applicants to encounter the same or similar difficulties which I have already described in relation to the first decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">The applicants contended that '[t]he plain words of para 285(g) [of the Act] also tell against the [Authority]'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">34 The opening words to s 285, which I have of course already extracted, but nevertheless merit further emphasis, are that ' [a]n application may be made to [the Authority] for reconsideration of any of the following decisions ', the notion of reconsideration being of wide import.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">Moreover the ensuing language of sub-paragraph (g) includes the word concerning , which was also said by the applicants to be of wide import, such that there could be no contextual reason to construe s 285(g) narrowly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">Hence the applicants contended on that basis that the Authority's decision not to vary the site condition at the centre of the disputation was clearly a decision concerning the conditions of the 1620 licence, that licence being of course an apparatus licence .</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">35 It was submitted by the applicants moreover that the wording of s 285(g) of the Act should be compared with other sub-paragraphs of s 285.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">I was referred again to s 285(f) which explicitly refers to the inclusion of conditions in an apparatus licence under paragraph 107(1)(g) ...' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">So much was said by the applicants 'clearly' to exclude review of a negative decision, that is to say, a decision not to includ[e] the operation of any conditions in an apparatus licence under s 107(1)(g), which statutory expression is used in marked contrast to what appears in s 285(g), which was described by the applicants as covering 'both positive and negative decisions' by reason of its use in particular of the broad notion of concerning .</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">36 It was further submitted by the applicants that if s 285(g) of the Act was intended to be limited to decisions to give a notice under s 111, the Legislature would have used an expression such as that used in s 285(qa), namely decisions giving a notice .</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">The point was said moreover to be made even more starkly when other sections of the Act are considered, such as s 118, which by para (a) of subs (1) thereof refers to 'a notice under section 111 relating to changes in licence conditions ...'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">The applicants submitted that it would have been a simple matter for the draftsperson to have used that expression in s 285(g) of the Act, had so much been the legislative intention, and further that the difference in expression provided an indication that para 285(g) has a wider operation than the phrase used in s 118(1)(a) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">There is considerable force in those submissions of the applicants upon the statutory texts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">Outline of the Authority's submissions in support of its objection to competency 
 
37 The Authority's principal contention was that the Act did not impose any duty upon it to consider or act upon requests made by licensees or others to vary the conditions of apparatus licences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">Instead s 111 of the Act reposed in the Authority a discretionary power to unilaterally vary or revoke conditions of apparatus licences, and s 111 did not provide for a means whereby a licensee could move the Authority to exercise its power under that provision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">The Act was said by the Authority to draw 'a clear distinction' between 'powers in respect of which an application may be made and is necessary and those where no provision is made for an application from an interested person'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">I was referred in that regard to s 286 of the Act, which was said to evidence the former situation, that section reading as follows:
 
 
 's 286 Deadlines for reaching certain decisions 
 
 (1) If this Act provides for a person to make an application to the ACMA for such a decision, the ACMA must make the decision: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) within 90 days after receiving the application; or 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) if the ACMA has, within those 90 days, given the applicant a written request for further information about the application --- within 90 days after receiving that further information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">' 
 
 
 
 

Subsection (2) provides for a deemed refusal by the Authority, if it has not informed an applicant of its decision within 90 days.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">Where any such application procedure is invoked, it was acknowledged by the Authority that it '... is under a duty to consider the application and indeed, must do so within a prescribed timeframe'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">
 

38 Section 286 appears in Part 5.6 of the Act entitled 'Review of decisions' and follows s 285, which provides for the making of applications to the Authority for reconsideration of the decisions listed in that section.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">Bearing in mind the location of s 286 within Part 5.6 of the Act, the meaning of ' application...for such a decision ' in s 286 must be read as a reference to an application to the Authority for a reconsideration under s 285, and not as a reference generally to any decision of the Authority under the Act for which application can be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">In any event, the absence of any such express 'application procedures' under the Act for the making by the Authority of decisions under s 111 was said by the Authority to imply that it lacked a duty to consider any request or application purportedly made by a licensee under s 111.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">I observe that the Authority did not draw the Court's attention to any species of decision under the Act for which an application procedure exists other than to applications for reconsideration of the decisions listed in s 285.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">39 The Authority next contended that where no application procedure is provided for, as was said to be the case with decisions made under s 111, the Authority may have a discretionary power that can be exercised, such as its power to vary conditions under s 111, but that the Authority would be under no duty to exercise that power, or even to consider whether or not to exercise that power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">Reference was made to two Full Federal Court authorities relating to the operation of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (' Migration Act '), as exemplifications of what was said to be a general principle that the mere existence of a discretionary power does not carry with it a duty to exercise the power, or even to consider whether or not to exercise the same.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">40 It is convenient to consider immediately whether either of those authorities do exemplify or otherwise lend support to that contention of the Authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">WAGJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 227 was concerned with the operation of s 427(1)(d) of the Migration Act , which provided that the Refugee Review Tribunal ('RRT') '... may require the Secretary to arrange for the making of any investigation ... that the Tribunal thinks necessary with respect to the review .</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">' The Full Court in WAGJ (Heerey, RD Nicholson and Mansfield JJ) held that s 427(1)(d) did not impose a duty upon the RRT to consider whether to exercise that power to order an investigation, their Honours placing emphasis upon such statutory words may and Tribunal thinks necessary .</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">I would observe that the Court in WAGJ did not purport to lay down any general principle or rule, their Honours' decision apparently being predicated on the above emphasised words in s 427(1)(d) , and the prevailing legislative context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">The issue arising relevantly in the second of those decisions relied upon by the Authority, being WAJQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 79 , was not concerned with any particular provision of the Migration Act at all, the appellant in that litigation contending that the Tribunal had erred by failing to enquire into the veracity of certain documents and correspondence provided by the appellant in support of his application for a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">It is not apparent that the appellant in WAJQ formulated his case by reference to the operation of s 427(1)(d) of that legislation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">The Full Court cited WAGJ as authority for the wider proposition that there is no duty on the RRT to make inquiries, the failure to carry out whereof would give rise to judicial review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">41 I am unable to obtain sufficient assistance from resort to authorities arising in the context of the Migration Act , which has its own terms and conditions for administrative review far removed from those contained in the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">Leaving aside contextual statutory differences, WAGJ and WAJQ do not purport to lay down any principle of general application to the effect that the existence of a discretionary power does not impute a duty to consider whether or not to exercise it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">Nor was either of WAGJ or WAJQ concerned with the meaning of ' decision ... made ... under an enactment ', as that expression appears in the ADJR Act, or otherwise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">42 It was the Authority's further contention that its officers paid due regard to policy formulated by the Authority concerning the location of MF NAS transmitters, and took the view, as they were said by the Authority to be entitled to do, that the proposed relocation advanced by the applicants did not meet the policy requirements apparent in the so-called '30/160 rule', or the 'make it a better rule' apparent in the NAS PIP policy, and that as a consequence, it was decided by the Authority that the applicants' proposal should not be further entertained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">The circumstances of the present case were said by the Authority in that context to be 'broadly analogous' to those considered in a joint judgment of a Full Federal Court (comprising Black CJ, Kiefel and Emmett JJ) in Bedlington v Chong (1998) 87 FCR 75, which was concerned with the operation of ss 48A and 48B of the Migration Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">The Authority relied upon Bedlington for the proposition that it is open to a decision-maker, who is under no duty to consider exercising a discretionary power, to draft a policy which identifies the types of cases in which the exercise of that discretion might be exercised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">43 Again I am unable to obtain sufficient assistance from resort to authorities involving the application and operation of the Migration Act , which in the case of Bedlington explicitly stipulated that ' the Minister does not have a duty to consider whether to exercise the [power] ... in any ... circumstances '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">The Full Court emphasised at 78 of its reasons for judgment that the particular language of subsection 48B(6) was the sole basis for their decision that the Minister was under no duty in any circumstances to exercise the relevant power under s 48B(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">The critical issue arising was whether the Departmental Secretary was under a duty to bring the application made for the exercise of the power under s 48B(1) to the Minister's attention in order that the Minister could personally determine whether or not to exercise that power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">Their Honours held that the use of policy guidelines by the Secretary as the basis for refusing to bring the application to the Minister's attention, where such guidelines were specifically intended to identify those cases in which the Minister might consider the exercise of his or her power was valid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">I have considerable difficulty in discerning the availability of assistance from that further authority, given that it relevantly involved a power that the provision required be exercised personally by the Minister, and concerned only the proposition that the Minister had no statutory obligation to make a decision, and again did not occur in an ADJR Act context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">Moreover there is no express provision in the Act (ie the legislation the subject of the present proceedings) to the effect that the Authority need not make any relevant decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">All that discourse put forward by the Authority here in relation to migration cases, in any event, ultimately still begs the question as to whether a decision not to make a decision in a particular context nevertheless constitutes a decision ... made... under an enactment within s 5 of the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">Taken to their logical conclusion, the Authority's submissions appear moreover to run contrary to the warning issued by Gummow J in Right to Life , which I have extracted above, to the effect that limiting the scope of the ADJR Act to decisions in respect of which there was a duty, performance of which might be required by a writ of mandamus would be contrary to the scheme of the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">In that latter regard, I would refer again to the text of s 3(2) of the ADJR Act earlier extracted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">44 In further support of the contention that a decision by an officer to the effect that a request does not fall within an established policy as to which decisions will or will not be entertained, is not a decision...made...under an enactment , the Authority referred me to two additional decisions of this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">The first was Brownsville Nominees Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 19 FCR 169, where Northrop J held that the Commissioner's refusal to issue an amended assessment under s 170 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) was not subject to review under s 7 of the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">Section 7(1) of the ADJR Act provides for the making of applications for review of the failure of a decision-maker to make a decision where, inter alia , that decision-maker has a duty to make a decision to which [the ADJR Act] applies .</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">Northrop J held at 173 of his reasons for judgment that s 170 did not impose any duty on the Commissioner to make an amended assessment of income tax upon the request of a taxpayer, and thus the application for review of the Commissioner's refusal to issue the amended assessment was not competent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">I would observe that the Commissioner's refusal to issue an amended assessment was expressed to the taxpayer in that case in the following terms (at 171):
 
 '...In the circumstances your request to have the subject assessments amended should remain in abeyance pending resolution of the appeal...'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">
 

Of course the issue thus arising fell for consideration in the context of the complexity of the code of that legislation as to the circumstances where an amendment to an assessment may be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">Brownsville Nominees did not involve the situation of a successful challenge to an assessment of tax by the Australian Tax Office made by a taxpayer, whether formally or informally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">The Authority contended nevertheless that there was no practical difference between that situation and the present, the Authority simply deciding here not to consider the request for a variation at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">
 

45 It is important to bear in mind, in any event, that the applicants have applied for review of the Authority's decision here under s 5(1) of the ADJR Act, and not under s 7 thereof, so that the only question with which I am presently concerned is whether or not the subject decision fulfilled the requirements of s 3(1) of the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">In that context I would observe what Lockhart J said at 62 of his reasons for judgment in Right to Life concerning Brownsville Nominees :
 
 'We were referred by counsel for the Secretary to the judgment of Northrop J in [ Brownsville Nominees ] as authority for the proposition that there was no "decision" within the meaning of s 5 of the ADJR Act because there was no duty imposed on the Secretary to make such a decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">Brownsville is not authority for that proposition...His Honour's decision was based squarely upon the duties imposed upon the Commissioner under the Assessment Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">' 
 

In similarly rejecting the application of Brownsville Nominees in the manner sought by the Secretary, Beaumont J concluded at 80 of his reasons for judgment that:
 
 'I have difficulty accepting the submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">In the first place, as has been noted, the definition of "decision" in s 3(1) of the ADJR Act is not confined to those cases where a duty to make a decision is imposed, although such decisions are also picked up...'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">
 

Moreover at 88 of his reasons for judgment, Gummow J expressed his agreement with:
 
 '...what [was] said in the reasons for judgment of the other members of the Court as to the inadequacy of [ Brownsville Nominees ] as authority for the proposition that in the present case there could be no decision attracting the ADJR Act unless the Secretary was under a duty to act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">' 
 

I need add nothing further as to the absence of any assistance of Brownsville to the Authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">46 A further authority referred to by counsel for the Authority in the course of argument was Carter v Minister for Aboriginal Affairs [2005] FCA 667.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">In that case, Ryan J held, inter alia , that the Minister's refusal to exercise his power under s 21D(2) of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 (Cth) to make a temporary declaration of preservation was not a decision for the purposes of s 3(1) of the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">47 Subsections 21D(1) and (2) of that particular legislation were in the following terms: 
 
 
 '(1) If a local Aboriginal community decides, whether after an application is made to it or on its own motion, that: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) a place or object in the community area is an Aboriginal place or Aboriginal object; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) that place or object is under threat of injury or desecration; 
 
 
 
 
 
 the community may advise the Minister that it considers a temporary declaration of preservation should be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">
 
 
 
 
 
 (2) On receiving advice under subsection (1) or determining on his or her own motion that a temporary declaration of preservation should be made, the Minister: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) shall, within 14 days, cause notice of the advice or determination to be given to any person who is likely to be affected by the making of a declaration; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) shall give any such person an opportunity to be heard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">' 
 
 
 

48 Ryan J found that the Minister there had not received advice from a local Aboriginal community in accordance with s 21D(1), and thus the issue of relevance was whether or not the Minister's decision not to determine[e] on his...own motion that a temporary declaration of preservation should be made was a reviewable decision for the purposes of s 5(1) of the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">The Minister had informed the applicants in writing that he would 'consider' their request for a determination on his own motion, but later told the applicants that he would not do so pending the resolution of another proceeding before this Court involving the same artefacts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">His Honour found that the Minister's decision was a decision to decline to determine[e]...on his own motion and was thus made 'preparatory' to the making of a decision to determine to make a temporary declaration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">Alternatively, his Honour characterised the decision declining to so determine[e] as 'a conclusion reached as a step on the way to an ultimate decision', which is not reviewable, for that reason also, thereby referring to dicta to like effect at 337 of Mason CJ's reasons for judgment in Bond .</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">49 The applicants submitted, in my opinion correctly, that the particular statutory framework addressed in Carter featured a 'staged process of decision-making' whereby before making the ultimate decision of imposing a temporary declaration of preservation , the Minister may make a decision to proceed with such a determination on his or her own motion, such a decision being clearly 'a step along the way'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">By contrast the present legislation (ie the Radiocommunications Act ) features no such stepped or staged decision-making, the power to make the ultimate or operative decision being conferred in its terms by s 111 and relevantly, s 111(1)(c).</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">On that basis at least, Carter is distinguishable from the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">50 The Authority submitted next that a similar conclusion to that which it advocated here was reached by an application of the principles stated by the High Court in Griffith University v Tang [2005] HCA 7 ; (2005) 213 ALR 724.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">The issue there arising was whether the decision of a university to exclude a candidate for a doctorate of philosophy on account of academic misconduct was made under an enactment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">In a majority finding to the contrary of that candidate's complaint, the following appears at [89] in the joint reasons for judgment of Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ to the negative of that proposition (their Honours' emphasis appears in non-italics):
 
 'The determination of whether a decision is "made... under an enactment" involves two criteria: first, the decision must be expressly or impliedly required or authorised by the enactment; and, secondly, the decision must itself confer, alter or otherwise affect legal rights or obligations, and in that sense the decision must derive from the enactment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">A decision will only be "made... under an enactment" if both these criteria are met.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">It should be emphasised that this construction of the statutory definition does not require the relevant decision to affect or alter existing rights or obligations, and it will be sufficient that the enactment requires or authorises decisions from which new rights or obligations arise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">Similarly, it is not necessary that the relevantly affected legal rights owe their existence to the enactment in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">Affection of rights or obligations derived from the general law or statute will suffice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">' 
 

Purportedly in the light of that dicta , the Authority contended that its '... decision not to entertain [WAL's] request, however it be characterised, did not confer, alter or otherwise affect legal rights', but '... left them precisely as they were before the applicants requested the [Authority] to exercise its non-compellable discretionary power'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">Even if that analysis of the Authority be correct in terms of the present circumstances of either one or both of the applicants, notwithstanding implications flowing historically from their enjoyment of transmission from the Tingalpa site, it is an analysis which in any event appears to fall short of the foregoing dicta in Griffith University that '... it will be sufficient that the enactment requires or authorises decisions from which new rights or obligations arise'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">I would add that counsel for the Authority conceded during the hearing that Griffith University would be of no assistance to him if I were to find that the Authority had in fact exercised its power under s 111 , as opposed to merely declining to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">At least the Authority's communications with the applicants in 2004 point to the former of those propositions as being the case, as do the Authority's file notes of the same year, as is I think sufficiently apparent from what I have earlier extracted therefrom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">
 

51 The submissions of the respondent Authority sought to conclude that '[f]or all of these reasons, the decision of the [Authority's] officers was not a decision under an enactment', and was '... not, therefore, a decision to which the [ADJR Act] applies ... [and] [s]imilarly, the lawfulness of the decision is not a matter arising under a law of the Parliament if it were made under a non-legislative policy'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">The Authority did not elaborate on that latter submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">However it is clear that it was predicated on the Authority's construction of its decision that was contended by the applicants to be 'highly technical' and 'prefer[ring] form over substance, contrary to the remedial character of the ADJR Act'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">In essence, as I have foreshadowed already, the respondent Authority contended that the 'decision' was nothing more than the refusal of its own officers to consider whether to exercise the Authority's power under s 111 of the Act, that determination having been made by the relevant officers by reference to the policies of the Authority encapsulated in NAS PIP and NAS BOP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">52 The Authority accepted that '... this Court has jurisdiction under s 39B(1A)(c) of the Judiciary Act to determine whether the [Authority] was under a duty to consider the applicants' request to vary [AusCoast's] licence condition', but asserted that '[n]onetheless, if this Court accepts that the [Authority] was not under such a duty (and remains free from such a duty), the Court would be unable to make an order in the nature of mandamus'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">Absent such an order, so the Authority further submitted, there was no proper basis for any of the relief sought by the applicants', thereby citing Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; ex parte Applicants S134/2002 (2003) 211 CLR 411 at [44]-[48] (Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ) and at [98]-[100] (Gaudron and Kirby JJ), in each such instance containing observations relating to the operation of s 417(1) of the Migration Act , whereby the Minister is empowered to substitute for the RRT's decision a decision more favourable to an applicant for relief, if ' ... the Minister thinks it is in the public interest to do so '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">Once again I have difficulty in identifying any sufficiency of assistance of authority from a context involving quite different legislation; indeed s 417(7) of the Migration Act at least then explicitly stipulated that ' [t]he Minister does not have a duty to consider whether to exercise the power under subsection (1) in respect of any decision, whether he or she is requested to do so by the applicant or by any other person, or in any other circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">' In any event, as the applicants rightly pointed out, whether or not mandamus might be available against the Authority in relation to the operation of s 111 of the Act, relief pursuant to s 39B(1A) of the Judiciary Act for declaratory relief was sought by the applicants' amended application which Jacobson J accepted for filing in Court on 25 August 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">I have of course earlier referred to the applicants' case for relief being framed on that basis by way of additional or alternative relief to that afforded by the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">53 As to what the Authority referred to as its 'related alternative motion', the Authority contended that since AusCoast is currently broadcasting from premises which are not the premises specified on the conditions of its licence, such conduct was unlawful and improper.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">Accordingly, in case the Court was otherwise minded to entertain a grant of relief following a substantive hearing, it was submitted that relief should be refused as a matter of discretion; since the applicants here seek to protect and validate unlawful and improper conduct, and thereby attract the operation of the maxim of equity 'he who comes into equity must come with clean hands', discussed in R Meagher, D Heydon and M Leeming, Meagher, Gummow and Lehane's Equity Doctrines &amp; Remedies , (4 th ed) at [3-110].</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">The relief presently sought by the applicants is however in the nature of administrative and not equitable relief, the applicants having not purportedly founded any case on equitable estoppel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">In any event I am of course presently concerned with the Authority's notice of objection to competency.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">The relevance of any such matters so raised by the Authority is limited to the Court's determination of final relief, should the Authority's objection to competency fail wholly or in part.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">54 I should add for completeness that in a short supplementary submission, the Authority repeated the essence of its earlier submissions, and submitted further in the alternative as follows ( inter alia ):
 
 'If the court accepts that there is no duty [for the Authority to consider a request made for a variation of an apparatus licence under s 111] but considers that, nonetheless, the Authority made a decision under s 111, the matter would need to go to a substantive hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">There would then be an argument about whether a reviewable error was made in that legislative context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">There would also be a discretionary issue too.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">' 
 

It is sufficient for me to respond to that supplementary submission at the present stage of the proceedings by referring to the interlocutory decision upon which I have arrived below in the light of the respective submissions of the parties, which have been addressed on the basis of the Authority's objection to competency.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">Conclusions 
 
55 I am of the opinion that the Authority's objection to competency in its presently amended form must be dismissed, for reasons which I have largely foreshadowed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">56 The applicants have rightly contended that the following decisions of the respondent Authority are reviewable by the Court under and pursuant to the provisions of the ADJR Act:
 
 
 (i) the decision of the Authority made on 30 June 2005 under s 111 of the Act not to exercise its power to change the condition on its radiocommunications apparatus licence number 1130030 (called the 1620 licence) granted to AusCoast, such that the site for the operation of that licence be altered from 170 Kingsley Terrace Manly, Brisbane in the State of Queensland to 320 Fleming Road, Tingalpa, Brisbane in that State ('the first decision'); 
 
 
 
 
 
 (ii) the further decision by the Authority made on 18 August 2005 not to reconsider the first decision under s 285(g) of the Act; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 (iii) the further decision by the Authority also made on 18 August 2005 to refuse WAL's request for a statement of reasons for the first decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">
 
 
 

57 I am further of the opinion, to the extent that it may therefore matter, that in so far as the Authority has contended that the subject decisions of the Authority did not arise under any laws made by the Parliament pursuant to s 39B(1A) of the Judiciary Act , that further contention must also fail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">58 It will have been appreciated from observations that I have made in the course of my outline of these reasons for judgment that I would reject the contention of the Authority that its decision-making of 30 June 2005 merely constituted a withholding from consideration of a request of either or both of the applicants to change the site condition of the 1620 licence, whether pursuant to an exercise of a discretionary function or power generally or at large on the Authority's part, or otherwise, and in particular whether by way of exercise of a discretionary power conferred under s 111 of the Act, or otherwise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">The applicants, or at least WAL on behalf of both of them, in substance and in reality, applied unambiguously to the Authority on 6 August 2004 to change the site condition for the subject apparatus licence being a change which the Authority was empowered to implement pursuant to s 111 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">A statutory decision-maker does not avoid the operation of the review provisions of the ADJR Act by purporting to create, whether explicitly or implicitly, a standpoint or position involving a decliner of entry upon statutory decision-making, or for that matter of consideration of decision-making unless the statutory scheme for decision-making so provides (cf Carter ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">So much however is in reality the position or standpoint which the Authority has seemingly endeavoured to adopt and maintain.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">59 Thus by way of reflection of the dictum I have cited from Bond , the communications of the Authority as evidenced from the outset by its faxed response of 16 August 2004 to the applicants' application of 6 August 2004 and thereafter, inclusive of its critical communication to WAL of 30 June 1995, the Authority indicated to the applicants the position which it had adopted or taken as inherently and essentially indicative of decision-making on its part, the same having for instance the 'character or quality of finality', and constituting and involving 'an outcome reflecting something in the nature of a determination of an application' within the scope of that dictum of Mason CJ in Bond I have earlier cited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">That communication of the Authority constituted or involved a decision 'at least in a practical sense, of the issue of fact falling for consideration'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">It was 'a substantive determination' as opposed to a 'procedural determination', to adopt the Chief Justice's further dictum in Bond .</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">60 Moreover by way of reflection of dicta I have cited from Right to Life , and in particular from that of Lockhart J at 62, I would characterise the Authority's conduct culminating in its faxed response of 30 June 2005 as similarly indicative of a conclusion having been reached by the Authority in or to the effect of the first decision postulated in the applicants' amended application filed in Court on 25 August 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">The Authority made thereby a decision under s 111 not to effect a variation to one of the conditions it had imposed on the 1620 licence pursuant to s 107(1)(g) of the Act, namely the condition stipulating the transmission site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">The Authority's communication of 30 June 2005 constituted or involved moreover the very opposite or antithesis of the decision which the applicants had been seeking from the Authority, commencing from WAL's application of 6 August 2004 made to the Authority, being a decision the implications and consequences whereof clearly and in substance affected rights and obligations of the applicants concerning the 1620 licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">61 It follows in my opinion that the Authority's objection to competency must fail, at least for the reason that such objection is founded on the erroneous proposition that no decision has been relevantly made under an enactment, pursuant to s 3(1) of the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">Whilst that conclusion renders unnecessary any conclusion to be reached as to whether a matter relevantly arose under any law made by the Parliament for the purpose of the operation of s 39B(1A) of the Judiciary Act , I am unable to identify any viable basis in favour of a negative response to that latter proposition of the applicants as well.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">It is moreover not accurate for the Authority to contend that its refusal was a decision made pursuant to a policy as opposed to an enactment, any resemblance here to the factual situation prevailing in Bedlington being merely chimerical, for the reasons that I have indicated above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">62 It follows from my foregoing conclusions that the Authority's refusal to vary the 1620 licence site condition involves a matter arising under a law made by Parliament of the Commonwealth, the legislative authority to make that decision being conferred by s 111 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">Accordingly I would further find that the purported ground of objection pleaded by the Authority in the alternative, namely that '... there is no proper basis upon which to grant relief to the applicant', must also fail, owing to the availability at least of declaratory relief to the applicants for the reasons I have earlier explained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">63 Accordingly the application for review of the first decision sought by the applicants' amended application filed in Court on 25 August 2005 must proceed to a final hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">64 It follows moreover, in the light of all of my foregoing findings, that the further applications to review the Authority's decision of 18 August 2005 not to reconsider its prior principal decision of 30 June 2005, and also the Authority's yet further decision made at the same time to refuse WAL's request for a statement of reasons in respect of the first decision, must also proceed to a final hearing, the first decision not being one excluded from the operation of s 13 of the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">65 I should add for completeness that the further concluding contention raised by the Authority in any event to the effect that since AusCoast presently broadcasts from premises at Tingalpa which are not the premises specified in the conditions of the 1620 licence, being conduct asserted by the Authority to be 'unlawful and improper', the Court should as a matter of discretion refuse that relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">That subject must be a question for another day, and is irrelevant to the issue of competency per se for the reasons I have already indicated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">Doubtless on that further occasion, the applicants would seek to pursue in more detail the circumstances and implications of the conduct of the Authority relating to the variation of the site condition on the 1611 licence to the Bracken Ridge Reservoir transmission site, being a conceivable issue apparently to be raised by the applicants from which I would necessarily withhold from further comment at this interlocutory stage of the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">Whether that subject is in any event a matter for legitimate consideration in the context of the administrative relief sought by the applicants would be a matter for submission at that further hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">66 The Authority having failed on what has been analogous to a demurrer to the applicants' cause of action, I see no good reason in principle why the applicants should not have the benefit of an award of costs in their favour of and incidental to the present application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">67 The proceedings will be stood over to a date to be fixed by agreement by the parties, or by the Court in the event that no agreement is reached, for the purpose or making such declarations and orders as may be appropriate to give effect to these reasons for judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">
 
 I certify that the preceding sixty-seven (67) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Conti.</sentence>

1 This is an appeal, pursuant to s 44 of the Administration Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) ('the AAT Act'), from a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal constituted by Mr P J Lindsay, Senior Member ('the Tribunal'), given on 18 January 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">2 The Tribunal's decision was recorded in the following terms:
 
 'The tribunal affirms the decision under review in relation to the inclusion of the sum of $1,228,500 in the applicant's assessable income for the year ended 30 June 1988, but in relation to penalty remits the matter to the respondent with the direction that the assessment for that income year be amended by remitting additional tax in full.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">' 
 

3 The Commissioner of Taxation ('the Commissioner') appeals from so much of the Tribunal's decision as remits the matter of additional tax to the Commissioner with the direction that such additional tax be remitted in full.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">4 The Commissioner, in his Amended Notice of Appeal, states that the following questions of law are raised on the appeal ---
 
 
 '1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Whether the Tribunal exceeded the jurisdiction conferred on it by section 14ZZ of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 [(Cth) ('the Administration Act')] in purporting to direct the Applicant to remit in full additional tax imposed on the Respondent for the year ended 30 June 1988.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">
 
 
 
 
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The proper interpretation of sections 14ZQ and 14ZS of the [Administration Act] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">
 
 
 
 
 
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Whether the Tribunal erred in law in purporting to direct the Applicant to remit additional tax in full.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">' 
 
 
 

5 The grounds of appeal are stated in the same document (at par 4) in the following terms:
 
 
 '4.1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The Tribunal erred in law in failing to hold that the Applicant's decision on objection refusing to remit additional tax imposed pursuant to sec 223 was an "ineligible income tax remission decision" under section 14ZS of the [Administration Act] and therefore not a "reviewable objection decision" for the purposes of section 14ZQ of that Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">
 
 4.2 The Tribunal erred in law in purporting to direct the Applicant to remit the additional tax in full, in circumstances where there was no jurisdiction to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">
 
 
 
 
 
 4.3 The Tribunal should have held that the Applicant's decision refusing to remit the additional tax was not a "reviewable objection decision" within the meaning of section 14ZQ of the [Administration Act] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">
 
 
 
 
 
 4.4 In so far as the Tribunal purported to direct the Applicant to remit additional tax payable under either section 207 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 or Division 1 of Part IIA of the [Administration Act] , the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to make such a direction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">
 
 
 
 
 
 4.5 If, contrary to the grounds set out in paragraphs 4.1 to 4.4 above, the Tribunal did have jurisdiction to direct that additional tax be remitted in full, the Tribunal, in purporting to make such a direction, erred in law in taking into account an irrelevant consideration namely the Applicant's consent to the matter remaining in abeyance before the Tribunal pending finalisation of other proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">' 
 
 
 
 BACKGROUND 
 
6 On 24 June 1994, following an audit, the Commissioner issued the respondent taxpayer with an amended assessment of income tax for the year ended 30 June 1988 including in his assessable income for that year an amount of $1,228,500 received by him in respect of a certain large infrastructure project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">Additional Tax for incorrect return, shown at label D of the notice of amended assessment, in the sum of $586,858.75, was also imposed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">7 The taxpayer, by his taxation agent, lodged an objection to the amended assessment by letter dated 5 July 1994, but the grounds were confined to the inclusion of the sum of $1,228,500 in his assessable income and did not put in issue the imposition of the additional tax of $586,858.75.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">8 By letter dated 16 February 1996 the Commissioner disallowed the taxpayer's objection for the reason:
 
 'It is considered that the income received from Kumagai Gumi Co Ltd and Transfield Pty Ltd forms part of your assessable income.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">' 
 
 

Not surprisingly, the objection decision made no reference to the imposition of additional tax because it was not raised as a ground of objection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Indeed, it was not mentioned in the objection at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">9 By letter dated 31 October 2003 solicitors acting for the taxpayer filed a statement of facts, issues and contentions on behalf of the taxpayer, however, the matter of additional tax was not raised as an issue and it certainly formed no part of the taxpayer's contentions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">Not surprisingly, the Commissioner's amended statement of facts, issues and contentions dated 26 October 2004, likewise made no reference to the matter of additional tax.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">10 The first time the matter of additional tax or 'penalty', as it is sometimes referred to, was raised was before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">How it was raised and why the Tribunal allowed it to be raised is not disclosed in the transcript of proceedings before the Tribunal, nor in the Tribunal's reasons for decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">However, these documents suggest, with respect, that:
 
 (i) Neither counsel for the taxpayer, nor counsel for the Commissioner, nor the Tribunal was aware that the taxpayer had not included any ground in his notice of objection going to the additional tax imposed at label D of the amended notice of assessment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">So much is exemplified in the following extract from p-95 of the transcript of the hearing on the second day (19 November 2004):
 'MR QUINN [Counsel for the Commissioner] : Just briefly on penalty, we say it is a matter --- the Tribunal stands in the shoes of the Commissioner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">We say there wasn't full and true disclosure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">I mean, it couldn't be the case that having regard to the number of taxpayers and the way the Commissioner must administer the Act that not to put at least copies of the agreements, that that was full disclosure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">To that extent we say that the amount of penalty is appropriate in the circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Unless there's anything else ---' 
 
 
 (ii) If counsel for the taxpayer was aware that the taxpayer had not included any ground in his notice of objection going to the additional tax imposed at label D of the amended notice of assessment, no attempt was made, by way of application to the Tribunal, to include the additional tax issue as an additional ground of objection and, even if an application was made, no such order was made by the Tribunal pursuant to s 14ZZK of the Administration Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">On the hearing of the appeal there was an interruptive protestation on the part of counsel for the taxpayer that any such conclusion would be misleading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">However, it was not taken further (apart from what was said to be anecdotal evidence from the bar table) in the written submissions I afforded counsel for the taxpayer, at his request, further time to make.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">


 
 (iii) The Tribunal seems to have regarded itself as having jurisdiction with respect to not only additional tax imposed at label D of the amended notice of assessment, but also additional tax by way of interest for late payment of tax assessed pursuant to s 207 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) ('the ITAA 36').</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">So much is exemplified in the following extract from p-77 of the transcript of the hearing on the second day:
 
 'MR RAPHAEL: Now, if we might go to the question of penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">
 
 MR LINDSAY: And on that the witness gave evidence, did he --- the applicant gave evidence that the sum assessed has not yet been paid?</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">
 
 MR RAPHAEL: Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">
 
 MR LINDSAY: So there must be quite a large amount of interest that has accrued on this sum, is that --- 
 
 MR RAPHAEL: Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">
 
 MR LINDSAY: I'm not privy to all of the --- I haven't read all of the detail, Mr Raphael --- 
 
 MR RAPHAEL: One should not give evidence from the bar table but --- 
 
 MR LINDSAY: No, I know, but you are trying to --- I'm getting some assistance from you, but is interest running from 1987 on this amount?</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">
 
 MR RAPHAEL: So I would tender the report of the Australian Tax Office ...' 
 
 It is also exemplified in the Tribunal's reasons for decision:
 
 
 
 '57.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">Where a taxpayer omits an item of assessable income from their return, s.223(7) deems the taxpayer to have made a statement in their return to the effect that they did not derive that item of income.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">The provision applies in this matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">
 
 
 
 
 
 58.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">... 
 
 
 
 
 
 59.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">I find that there are mitigating circumstances present in this matter that should be taken into account on review in the exercise of the discretion in s.227(3) to remit additional tax: 
 
 
 
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 
 
 60.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">... 
 
 
 
 
 
 61.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">I accept the applicant's submission that this transaction or dealing is one that falls into the clearly arguable category.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">I also accept that his income tax return gave the respondent some information about the transaction and this should be contrasted with the situation where there is a total omission of any reference to the particular transaction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">Having regard to the policy of encouraging accuracy and completeness of returns that is embodied in s.223, but being cognisant also that the discretion has been introduced to mitigate potential harshness resulting from the imposition of penalty under s.223(1) being double the amount of tax avoided, I am satisfied that this is an appropriate case in which to remit the culpability component of the penalty in full.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">In relation to the per annum component, it is relevant to note that the respondent consented to the matter being held in abeyance for a number of years pending the finalisation of proceedings brought by Jones, extending to his appeals to the High Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">I consider it appropriate that any per annum component be remitted for the entire period from the date of issue of the amended assessment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">' 
 
 
 

11 While the Tribunal's ultimate decision ([2], supra) in relation to 'penalty' is clearly a reference to additional tax imposed at label D of the amended notice of assessment, it is equally clear, in my view, that what the Tribunal is referring to in the last two sentences of par 61 of its reasons for decision and in the extract from the transcript cited above is the additional tax by way of interest pursuant to s 207 of the ITAA 36 and, if it is, it is clearly beyond the Tribunal's jurisdiction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">This latter matter was not, however, the subject of the Tribunal's ultimate decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">It follows that ground 4.5 of the Amended Notice of Appeal is misconceived.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">12 I hesitate to suggest this, but it seems to me that the Tribunal's analysis of the 'penalty' issue was a function of the confused thinking inherent in the submissions put to the Tribunal by both counsel below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">This is further exemplified in the Commissioner's grounds of appeal and in his original written submissions, both having as their focus the construction and application of s 14ZS and, by force of the definitions therein, s 14ZQ of the Administration Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">13 It is s 14ZS, as originally enacted (see Taxation Laws Amendment (No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">3) Act 1991 (Cth)), that applies to objection decisions that relate to the remission of additional tax under s 223 of the ITAA 36.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">As originally enacted, s 14ZS relevantly provided:
 
 
 '(1) For the purposes of this Part, an objection decision is an ineligible income tax remission decision if subsection (2) ... applies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">
 
 
 
 
 
 (2) An objection decision is an ineligible income tax remission decision if it relates to the remission of additional tax payable by a taxpayer under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 other than Division 11 of Part IIIAA , except where the additional tax is payable under Part VII of that Act and its amount, after the decision is made, exceeds: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) ... 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) in the case of additional tax payable under section 223 of that Act because of the making of a statement: 
 
 
 
 
 (i) if the statement relates to only one year of income --- the amount calculated, in respect of the period commencing on the day that is the prescribed day in relation to the taxpayer in relation to the year of income and ending on the day on which the assessment of the additional tax is made, at the rate of 20% per year of the amount of the relevant affected tax in relation to the taxpayer in relation to the year of income; or 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (ii) ...' (Emphasis added) 
 
 
 
 

14 Relevantly, s 14ZQ defined 'objection decision' as having the meaning given by subs 14ZY(2), namely, by reference to subs 14ZY(1), a decision of the Commissioner to allow an objection, wholly or in part, or to disallow it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">15 It is difficult to understand the focus of the Commissioner on s 14ZS of the Administration Act in the present case when neither the taxpayer's objection nor, in consequence, the Commissioner's objection decision, referred in any way to the remission of additional tax imposed by the amended notice of assessment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">In support of that focus I was referred to cases which, correctly in my view, hold that the words 'relates to' are wide words signifying some connection between two subject matters --- with the connection or association signified by the words being either direct or indirect, substantial or real.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">However, in the present case, there is absolutely no connection or association between the objection decision and the remission of additional tax payable under s 223 of the ITAA 36.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">It may be, as the Full court of this Court observed in Grollo Nominees Pty Ltd v FC of T (1997) 73 FCR 452 at 523, 
 
 'that it would seem an odd thing if there were ... an appeal to the Tribunal on the question of the amount of income tax payable which did not carry with it the right to question any consequential imposition of additional tax', 
 
 

but this is such a case, in the absence of the Tribunal making an order pursuant to s 14ZZK of the Administration Act allowing the taxpayer to include the additional tax issue as an additional ground of objection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">In short, the objection decision in the present case is not an ineligible income tax remission decision under s 14ZS of the Administration Act and, insofar as the Commissioner's appeal is grounded on this issue, it must fail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">16 In his written submissions in reply, the Commissioner refocussed his argument, to where it always should have been focussed, on subs 43(1) of the AAT Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">17 Subsection 43(1) of the AAT Act is in the following terms:
 
 'For the purpose of reviewing a decision, the Tribunal may exercise all the powers and discretions that are conferred by any relevant enactment on the person who made the decision and shall make a decision in writing: 
 
 
 
 (a) affirming the decision under review; 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) varying the decision under review; or 
 
 
 
 
 
 (c) setting aside the decision under review and: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (i) making a decision in substitution for the decision so set aside; or 
 
 (ii) remitting the matter for reconsideration in accordance with any directions or recommendations of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">' 
 
 
 
 

18 The Commissioner submitted that the present appeal was one where the remission of penalty by the Tribunal could not have been for the purpose of reviewing the decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">It was not relevant to the making of the decision because the parameters of that decision had already been set by the taxpayer's objection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">It could not have been properly raised by the taxpayer before the Tribunal unless and until an order was obtained by the taxpayer under s 14ZZK(a) of the Administration Act which did not occur.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">As such, there could not be 'an association' between the power exercised by the Tribunal and the decision under review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">If an objection had been made to the assessment of penalty and an objection decision had been made in relation to that matter, there may have been (subject to the operation of s 14ZS of the Administration Act) some basis for saying that the exercise of a power to remit by the Tribunal was in the words of Hill J in Secretary, Department of Social Security v Hodgson (1992) 37 FCR 32 'relevant to the making of the decision under review'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">There would be present 'an association' between any exercise of discretion by the Tribunal to remit penalty and the objection decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">19 In my view, this misconceives the matter and puts an impermissible gloss upon s 43.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">20 While the taxpayer did not include in his objection a ground putting in issue the imposition of additional tax; and while the Commissioner's objection decision disallowing the taxpayer's objection did not, in consequence, deal with that issue; and while the taxpayer had no right to agitate the issue before the Tribunal unless the Tribunal otherwise ordered (s 14ZZK(a) of the Administration Act), which the Tribunal did not, nevertheless, in deciding the taxpayer's objection, the Commissioner could have further remitted the additional tax imposed at label D of the notice of amended assessment, pursuant to the discretion vested in him by subs 227(3) of the ITAA 36.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">The fact that he had already exercised this discretion, at the time of assessment to remit the additional tax to $586,858.75 was no bar or impediment to his further remission of the additional tax at the time of making his objection decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">21 If this be right, then it is difficult to see why subs 43(1) of the AAT Act did not give the Tribunal jurisdiction to make that part of the decision against which this appeal is brought, namely, remission of the penalty matter to the Commissioner with the direction that the assessment for the year ended 30 June 1988 be amended by remitting additional tax in full.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">Subsection 43(1) of the AAT Act has been construed as not requiring the power or discretion to be exercised by the Tribunal as being necessarily involved in the making of the decision under review: Secretary, Department of Social Security v Hodgson supra at 39 --- 40.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">In Commonwealth Bank Officers Superannuation Corporation Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCAFC 244 (30 November 2005, unreported) the Full Court of this Court observed at [29] --- [30]:
 
 '...Section 43 empowers the Tribunal to exercise all the powers and discretions conferred upon the original decision-maker, provided it does so for the purpose of reviewing a decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">Provided the necessary purpose is present, the power conferred upon the Tribunal is not otherwise limited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">It is neither necessary nor permissible to put a gloss upon s 43 that would permit the Tribunal to exercise the discretion maker's powers and discretions only when those powers or discretions are necessarily interdependent with the decision under review, or where the power or discretion to be exercised by the Tribunal is necessarily involved in the making of the decision under review --- see Secretary, Department of Social Security v Hodgson [supra].</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">
 
 Thus, so long as the exercise of powers and discretions by the Tribunal is for the purpose of reviewing a decision, all of the powers and discretions conferred by any relevant enactment on the decision-maker who made the decision, can be exercised by the Tribunal' (Emphasis)
 

22 In making this observation, the Full Court was adopting the views expressed by Hill J in Hodgson .</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">In particular, what his Honour went on to say in that case at 40:
 
 'Of course there must be an association between the power to be exercised by the Tribunal and the decision under review, but that association is to be found in the restriction of the grant of power in s 43(1) to the purpose of the Tribunal's review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">The test is one of relevance rather than dependence .</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">Where the exercise of a power or discretion is relevant to the making of the decision under review then, if requested, the Tribunal may exercise the discretion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">' (Emphasis)
 

23 There can be no doubt, in the present case, that the exercise by the Tribunal of the discretion to remit the matter of the additional tax to the Commissioner with a direction that the additional tax be remitted in full is relevant to the making of the objection decision, if not dependent upon it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">In that sense, the Tribunal exercised the discretion for the purpose of reviewing the objection decision and any argument that it did not must be rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">24 For the foregoing reasons, the appeal must be dismissed with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">
 
 I certify that the preceding twenty-four (24) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Edmonds.</sentence>

 The Victorian Arts Centre Trust 
 

 
 10 The legislative history of the Victorian Arts Centre Trust ('the Trust') goes back at least to the National Art Gallery and Cultural Centre Act 1956 (Vic) ('the 1956 Act').</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">The preamble to the 1956 Act recited that a power to reserve certain land as a site for a National Art Gallery and Cultural Centre had been given to the Governor-in-Council under the Melbourne South Land Act 1946 (Vic), and that it was expedient to make provision for the vesting of such land in a committee constituted for the purpose of raising funds and providing a suitable building on such site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Section 3(1) of the 1956 Act provided: 


 
 'For the purposes of raising funds for the erection of a suitable building on the land reserved under the Principal Act and for the erection of such a building on such land there shall be a committee which committee shall be a body corporate under the name of the " National Art Gallery and Cultural Centre Building Committee " with perpetual succession and a common seal and shall be capable in law of suing and being sued.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">' 
 
 
 11 Section 5 provided for the grant to the National Art Gallery and Cultural Centre Building Committee ('the Building Committee') of land reserved as a site for a National Art Gallery and Cultural Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">Section 8 made provision for part of the land concerned to be used as a road, without such use operating to dedicate it as a public highway, and for part of the land to be used for ornamental purposes, for which the City of Melbourne was to have responsibility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">Section 9(1) provided that the Building Committee would be entitled to the rents and profits of any land granted to it by the Crown.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">


 
 12 The 1956 Act was amended by Act No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">6522 of 1959.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">The amendments included the insertion among the powers of the Building Committee of the power to borrow on terms and conditions approved by the Treasurer of Victoria and the addition of a power, granted to the Treasurer of Victoria, to guarantee the repayment of any sum borrowed by the Building Committee with the Treasurer's approval and any interest on such sum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">


 
 13 By s 12(1)(b) of Act No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">8249 of 1972, the Building Committee was renamed the Victorian Arts Centre Building Committee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">


 
 14 The Trust was established by the VAC Act, which came into operation on 13 March 1980.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">Section 4 provided: 


 
 '(1) There shall be established a body corporate by the name of the 
 Victorian Arts Centre Trust which shall have perpetual succession and 
 a common seal and shall be capable in law of suing and of being sued 
 and of taking purchasing holding demising selling transferring 
 conveying mortgaging or otherwise disposing of real and personal 
 property for the purposes of and subject to this Act and of being and 
 suffering all acts matters and things which bodies corporate may by 
 law do and suffer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">
 
 (2) Subject to the general direction and control of the Minister the Trust 
 shall be responsible for the management of the Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">' 
 
 
 15 The word 'Centre' is defined in s 3 of the VAC Act as including the relevant land, and the buildings and improvements erected on it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">By s 2(a) and (b) of the VAC Act, the Building Committee went out of office on the day on which the VAC Act came into operation, and the Trust became its successor in law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">By s 2(d) of the VAC Act, all property vested in the Building Committee became vested in the Trust on that date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">


 
 16 The functions of the Trust are set out in s 5 of the VAC Act: 


 
 '(1) The functions of the Trust are&#8722; 
 
 (a) to control, manage, operate, promote, develop and maintain 
 the Centre; and 
 
 (b) to present and produce theatrical performances, operas, plays, 
 dramas, ballets and musical and other performances and 
 entertainment of any kind at any place; and 
 
 (c) to promote the use of the theatres, concert hall and other 
 places of assembly by suitable persons and bodies; and 
 
 (d) to provide leadership in the promotion and development of the 
 performing arts; and 
 
 (e) to ensure the maintenance, conservation, development and 
 promotion of the State collection of performing arts material; 
 and 
 
 (f) to oversee the exhibition of performing arts material from the 
 State collection and make any performing arts material from 
 the State collection available on loan to persons or institutions; 
 and 
 
 (fa) to establish, maintain, conserve, develop, promote and exhibit 
 the public art collection; and 
 
 (fb) to make any object from the public art collection available for 
 study or loan to persons or institutions, subject to any 
 conditions that the Trust determines; and 
 
 (g) to carry on, whether within or outside Victoria, whether alone 
 or in association with any other person or persons and whether 
 or not in relation to the Centre, a business of providing 
 ticketing, inventory management of admissions, marketing and 
 related services; and 
 
 (h) to perform any other functions appropriate to the Centre as the 
 Minister may approve; and 
 
 (i) to carry out any other function conferred on the Trust under 
 this Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">
 
 (2) In carrying out its functions, the Trust must endeavour to contribute to 
 the enrichment of the cultural, educational, social and economic life of 
 the people of Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">' 
 
 
 17 The powers of the Trust, conferred by s 6 of the VAC Act, are the sorts of powers ordinarily conferred on a statutory corporation, with the addition of some that might be considered unusual for a government body.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">For example, s 6(2) confers on the Trust the following powers: 


 
 '(e) to apply for and hold any licence or permit under the Liquor Control 
 Reform Act 1998 or any other Act; 
 
 (f) to register, purchase or apply for or otherwise acquire either wholly 
 or in part any invention, copyright, trade-mark or other mark or 
 design, patent, patent rights and privileges, licences, concessions or 
 other like rights which in the opinion of the Trust will be of assistance 
 to the Trust in carrying out its functions and to sell, dispose of, use, 
 exercise and develop such rights or inventions or to grant licences or 
 privileges in respect thereof; 
 
 ... 
 
 (h) to install, use, work and maintain film cameras and projectors and 
 broadcasting and television apparatus, and to grant the right of 
 installing, using, working and maintaining the same within the areas 
 under its control upon such terms and conditions and subject to the 
 payment of such charges as may be determined by the Trust; 
 
 (i) to print or reproduce in any manner or form and to publish or to 
 arrange for the printing or reproduction or publishing of plays, music, 
 programmes, posters and advertisements and such other material as 
 the Trust may deem expedient and to acquire the copyright therein; 
 
 (j) to commission plays, compositions, musicals, ballets, operas or other 
 works;' 
 
 
 18 The Trust's borrowing powers, conferred by s 7 of the VAC Act, are confined to borrowing with the approval of the Treasurer and subject to such terms, conditions and limits as the Treasurer imposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">The Treasurer has power, given by s 7(3), to guarantee repayment and the payment of interest, charges and expenses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">


 
 19 By amendment to the VAC Act in 2000, s 14(4) provides that a person employed by the Trust is not, in respect of that employment, subject to the provisions of the Public Sector Management and Employment Act 1998 (Vic).</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">Also by later amendment, ss 3A and 3B of the VAC Act provide that the Trust has vested in it collections of performing arts material and artworks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">By s 18 of the VAC Act, the Trust may not sell or dispose of any item that is part of those collections without advertising its intention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">If any objection is received, the decision whether to sell is one for the Minister, or a delegate of the Minister.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">By amendment of the VAC Act in 1994, s 18A was inserted, to give the Trust power to make by-laws.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">


 
 20 It may be relevant to observe how the Trust sees itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">In its annual report for 2003-2004, the Trust described itself as follows: 


 
 'Purpose and statutory functions 
 
 The core purpose of the Victorian Arts Centre Trust (the Trust) is to enrich the lives of Victorians --- culturally, educationally, socially and economically 
 ( Victorian Arts Centre Act 1979 Section 5 ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">
 
 The Trust's responsibilities include: 
 
 &#8226; to control, manage, operate, promote, develop and maintain the Arts 
 Centre; 
 
 &#8226; to produce and present theatrical performances of any kind; 
 
 &#8226; to promote the use of the Arts Centre by the community; 
 
 &#8226; to ensure the maintenance, conservation, development, promotion 
 and exhibition of the State collection of performing arts materials 
 and the public art collection, as well as making material available 
 for study or loan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">
 
 Our role 
 
 &#8226; providing leadership in the creation, presentation, promotion and 
 advocacy of the performing arts; 
 
 &#8226; stimulating curiosity and understanding of the performing arts; 

 &#8226; increasing accessibility and enjoyment of the performing arts; 

 &#8226; creating partnerships that increase the value and potential of the 
 performing arts; 
 
 &#8226; exercising responsible care and presentation of publicly owned 
 cultural assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">
 
 Our vision 
 
 Our vision is of a society that values the performing arts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">' 
 
 
 21 In two places on its web site, the Trust describes itself as: 


 
 'a statutory authority of the Arts Portfolio.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">The Arts Portfolio is 
 administered by Arts Victoria, a division of the Department of Premier 
 and Cabinet.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">' 
 
 
 22 Further, on its web page, the Trust says: 


 
 'The Arts Centre is the flagship of the performing arts in Victoria, and the focal point of Melbourne's cultural precinct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">The Arts Centre is owned by the people of Victoria, and we welcome people at large to experience all that the Arts Centre has to offer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">
 
 In assocciation [ sic ] with some of Australia's top performing arts companies, and an array of national and international companies, we present a unique diversity of arts and entertainment choices all year round.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">The Arts Centre also offers eating and exhibitions to appeal to every age, taste and budget.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">' 
 
 
 23 The Arts Victoria Act 1972 (Vic) creates the office of Director, Arts Victoria, and provides for the appointment of a body called the Victorian Council of the Arts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">Section 4 of that Act provides, in relation to the Department of Premier and Cabinet: 


 
 'The objects of the Department under this Act are&#8722; 
 
 (a) to develop and improve the knowledge understanding appreciation 
 and practice of the Arts in Victoria; 
 
 (b) to increase the availability and accessibility of the Arts to the public of 
 Victoria; 
 
 (c) to encourage and assist in the provision of facilities to enable the Arts 
 to be performed or displayed; 
 
 (d) to continually survey and assess the position of the Arts in Victoria 
 and to report to the Parliament at least once in every year on the 
 condition of the Arts in Victoria and to suggest ways in which the Arts 
 may be further and better assisted; 
 
 (e) to administer the Acts and enactments for which the Minister is 
 responsible; 
 
 (f) to advise and co-operate with other Departments of the Government 
 public statutory authorities municipalities and other persons or bodies 
 concerned with the promotion or practice of the Arts in Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">' 
 
 
 24 It is clear that the Trust is not a State Government department, for the purposes of the phrase 'State Government Departments and Instrumentalities' in the award clauses with which this case is concerned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">There is a clear contrast between the Trust and Arts Victoria, which is described as a division of what is undoubtedly a State Government department.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">The test for determining whether a particular body is an 'instrumentality' of a State, within the ordinary meaning of that term, is found in Re Anti-Cancer Council of Victoria; Ex parte State Public Services Federation [1992] HCA 53 ; (1992) 175 CLR 442 at 448, where the High Court said: 


 
 'It is well settled that union eligibility rules are to be interpreted liberally and according to their ordinary and popular meaning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">However, the expression "State instrumentality" is one that carries much the same meaning in popular usage as in a legal context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">That meaning directs attention to the purpose or end served, so that a body is a State instrumentality if it is empowered to and does, in fact, serve some State government purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">And that is so even if it is neither a servant nor an agent of the State.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">' [Footnotes omitted]
 
 
 25 Among the authorities cited for the central proposition is the passage in the judgment of Isaacs and Rich JJ in Federated Municipal and Shire Council Employees' Union of Australia v Melbourne Corporation [1919] HCA 72 ; (1919) 26 CLR 508 at 530---531, where their Honours said: 


 
 'If a municipality either (1) is legally empowered to perform and does perform any function whatever for the Crown, or (2) is lawfully empowered to perform and does perform any function which constitutionally is inalienably a Crown function &#8722; as, for instance, the administration of justice &#8722; the municipality is in law presumed to represent the Crown, and the exemption applies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">Otherwise, it is outside that exemption, and, if impliedly exempted at all, some other principle must be resorted to.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">The making and maintenance of streets in the municipality is not within either proposition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">' 
 
 
 26 In the Anti-Cancer Council case, the court held that the Anti-Cancer Council of Victoria ('the ACCV') was not a 'State instrumentality', within the meaning of that expression in a trade union's eligibility rules.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">The ACCV was not under ministerial control.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">Its only function that might have been described as serving a State Government purpose was the receipt of reports and the keeping and compiling of a register, for which the ACCV received a small amount of government funding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">Significantly, there was no obligation imposed on the ACCV with respect to the reports it received or the cancer register.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">The court held that the ACCV fell within another limb of the rule of the trade union in question, which defined those eligible for membership.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">


 
 27 Counsel for the respondent relied on R v Industrial Court of South Australia; Ex parte Australian Broadcasting Commission (1976) 13 SASR 460.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">The Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia held that the Australian Broadcasting Commission ('the ABC') was not an 'instrumentality or agency of the Government of the Commonwealth', within the meaning of s 114 of the Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1972---1975 (SA).</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">At 284, Bray CJ, with whom Hogarth J agreed, referred to Electricity Trust of South Australia v Linterns Ltd [1950] SASR 133, in which it was held that the Electricity Trust of South Australia was a government instrumentality, as it managed the undertaking for the supply of electricity and the mining of coal in South Australia, exercised its functions on behalf of the Crown, and was the means or agency for managing a Crown asset.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">At 284---285, Bray CJ conceded that the ABC might be regarded as an instrumentality of the Commonwealth, but expressed the view that it could not be regarded as an instrumentality of the 'Government' of the Commonwealth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">His Honour took the view that the word 'Government', with a capital initial, in s 114 meant the executive government of the Commonwealth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">At 285, his Honour examined various provisions of the statute creating the ABC, emphasising the degree of autonomy from the executive government enjoyed by the ABC (with ministerial control only over a small number of specified functions, or in some exceptional specified circumstances), and the obligation of the ABC to indemnify the Postmaster-General in respect of any claim for anything done by the Postmaster-General's Department at the request of the ABC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">His Honour also pointed out that there was nothing in the statute declaring that the ABC held its assets on behalf of the Crown.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">At 285---286, Bray CJ also regarded as relevant the question whether the degree of ministerial control was sufficient to entitle the ABC to the shield of the Crown.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">Assuming it to have been decided correctly, the ABC case is readily distinguishable from the present.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">


 
 28 In the present case, one of the most striking features of the Trust is the extent to which it is subject to ministerial control.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">By s 4(2) of the VAC Act, the Trust's management of the Victorian Arts Centre is expressly subject to the general direction and control of the relevant Minister of the Crown.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">The Trust can only perform functions outside those expressly conferred by s 5(1) if the Minister approves of such functions (see s5(1)(h)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">The exercise of the Trust's borrowing power is only possible with the approval of the Treasurer, under s 7.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">The extent of ministerial control is such that the Trust would be very likely to have the benefit of the immunity of the Crown from the application of legislation not expressed to bind the Crown, or from being sued or convicted of a criminal offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">In determining whether a statutory authority has such immunity, the extent to which it is subject to ministerial control under its establishing legislation is of great importance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">See Superannuation Fund Investment Trust v Commissioner of Stamps (SA) [1979] HCA 34 ; (1979) 145 CLR 330 at 347---350 per Stephen J, and State Bank of New South Wales v Commonwealth Savings Bank of Australia [1986] HCA 62 ; (1986) 161 CLR 639 at 650.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">


 
 29 The first function of the Trust, listed in s 5(1) of the VAC Act, is to control, manage, operate, promote, develop and maintain the Victorian Arts Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">The land and buildings comprising the Victorian Arts Centre are vested in the Trust, by virtue of s 2(d) of the VAC Act, and by virtue of the vesting of what was formerly Crown land in the Trust's predecessor, the Building Committee, by the 1956 Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">


 
 30 The legislative history, and the terms of the VAC Act, suggest strongly that the principal purpose for the Trust's existence is to hold the title to, and to manage, a major public asset on behalf of the Crown in right of the State of Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">That this is the purpose of the VAC Act is confirmed by reference to the speech of the Minister for the Arts upon the second reading of the bill that became the VAC Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">In the course of that speech, the Minister said: 


 
 'The Government's investment in the project to date has been substantial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">Its commitment to it has been a strong one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">This Bill provides a means of protecting that investment by establishing an operating style that is flexible, business-like and expressly designed for the needs of a major performing arts centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">The centre is not just a set of buildings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">' 
 
 
 31 This extract from the second reading speech also suggests that the powers to which I have referred in [17], which I have described as unusual for a government body, have been conferred on the Trust as a means of enabling the better performance by the Trust of its principal function.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">The unusual powers enable the Trust to act as an impresario and a promoter, so that it can do all that might be thought necessary to manage effectively the important public asset vested in it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">When viewed in this way, the unusual powers do not detract from the Trust's otherwise clear status as a government instrumentality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">Further, the removal of the employees of the Trust from the area of operation of the Public Sector Management and Employment Act 1998 (Vic), by s 14(4) of the VAC Act, is seen simply as a means of achieving the degree of flexibility thought to be necessary for the Trust to exercise its range of powers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">Again, it should not be thought that such flexibility is necessarily inconsistent with the Trust being a government instrumentality, especially when it is viewed in the light of the ancillary nature of the unusual powers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">


 
 32 Another significant indicator that the Trust is established to serve a government purpose is the grant to it, by s 18A of the VAC Act of the power to make by-laws.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">The delegation of legislative power suggests that the Trust carries on governmental activity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">See State Bank of New South Wales at 651.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">


 
 33 The examination of the legislative history, and of the current state of the VAC Act, makes it difficult to avoid the conclusion that the Trust is both empowered to serve, and does serve a State Government purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">That purpose is the control and management of a significant public asset, which successive governments of Victoria have wished to make available for the economic and cultural enrichment of the citizens of Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">The information on the Trust's web site confirms this view.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">The Trust therefore falls clearly within the ordinary meaning of the phrase 'State instrumentality'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">


 
 34 Counsel for the respondent submitted that the expression 'State Government Departments and Instrumentalities' in cl 8A(a)(ii) of the 1994 Award and cl 15.3.1(b) of the 2003 Award should not bear its ordinary meaning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">His submissions were based on the history of the making of the two awards and the circumstances surrounding them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">He also advanced a number of other arguments about the construction of the relevant provisions, including the argument that a purposive construction of them should be adopted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">
 The history and context of the awards 
 

 
 35 Prior to 1992, terms and conditions of employment in the contract cleaning industry in Victoria were regulated pursuant to Victorian law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">By that time, there were two main awards regulating the contract cleaning industry, the Building Services Award and the Building Services (State Government Departments and Instrumentalities) Award .</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">


 
 36 In or about 1992, the Victorian Government began to contract out the cleaning of government premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">As a consequence, the applicant or one of its predecessor unions applied to the Industrial Relations Commission of Victoria to vary the Building Services (State Government Departments and Instrumentalities) Award .</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">The variation sought was the insertion of a clause that would ensure that the conditions in that Award, which were superior to those in the Building Services Award , would continue to be available to employees cleaning government premises in Victoria, although those employees were employed by contractors and not by the State of Victoria itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">On 21 September 1992, Commissioner Pimm made an order, inserting into the Building Services (State Government Departments and Instrumentalities) Award a new clause, designated as cl 1A Incidence of Award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">So far as is relevant to this proceeding, that clause provided: 


 
 'The Building Services (State Government Departments and Instrumentalities) Award applies to the whole of the State of Victoria for persons engaged in the provision of building services in the occupations of building attendant, caretaker, cleaner, lift attendant or security officer, howsoever designated, employed --- 
 
 (a) By a contractor engaged by a State Government Department or 
 Instrumentality'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">
 
 
 37 On 29 October 1992, when the Industrial Relations Commission of Victoria in full session made a new Building Services (State Government Departments and Instrumentalities) Award , to supersede the former award of that name, this incidence clause appeared in Pt A of that award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">


 
 38 Counsel for the respondent contended that, both before and after the insertion of the incidence of award clause, cleaners at the Victorian Arts Centre were employed by a contractor and were not paid any allowance referable to the Trust being a government instrumentality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">He contended that the purpose of the incidence of award clause was solely to ensure that superior terms and conditions of employment enjoyed by cleaners employed by the State of Victoria continued to apply when the State contracted out the cleaning of its premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">


 
 39 Not long after October 1992, there was a substantial flight from Victorian state awards to federal awards, as unions attempted to avoid new Victorian legislation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">The applicant attempted to obtain a federal award for cleaners.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">Employers in the industry opposed this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">Although the applicant was successful in overcoming an objection that the Commission had no jurisdiction to make an award, the Commission refused to make an interim award sought by the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">On 25 October 1993, a Full Bench of the Commission published a decision following a review of wage fixing principles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">Among the principles it laid down for the making of first federal awards was a principle providing that: 


 
 'In awards regulating the employment of workers previously covered by a State award or determination, existing State award rates and conditions prima facie will be the proper award rates and conditions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">' 
 
 
 40 Following negotiations about the making of a federal award for the contract cleaning industry, the applicant entered into a memorandum of agreement dated 16 March 1994 ('the memorandum of agreement'), with the Australian Building Services Association, the Property Services Council of Australia, the Victorian Employers Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry, the Australian Chamber of Manufactures and Eski Cleaning Services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">That memorandum of agreement provided relevantly as follows: 


 
 'The parties agree: 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">To make a joint application for a Federal Award that preserves rates 
 of pay and allowances as they were prescribed for the contract 
 cleaning industry in the expired awards of the former Industrial 
 Relations Commission of Victoria, known as the Building Services 
 Award, the Building Services (State Government Departments &amp; 
 Instrumentalities) Award, the Miscellaneous Workers Post-Secondary 
 Education (TAFE) Award and the Cleaners and Domestic Arts 
 Assistants (Government Schools) Award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">That the Award made prescribe common conditions of employment 
 for the industry, other than where to prescribe such common 
 conditions of employment would result in a reduction in income 
 contrary to Point 1 of this agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">
 
 It is acknowledged by the parties that the implementation of 1 and 2 
 of this agreement shall be staged as follows: 
 
 (a) An initial application to the Commission for a minimum rates 
 award, the scope and Incidence of that award being in similar 
 terms to the Incidence of the former Building Services Award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">

 (b) A second stage where the paid rates applicable in the former 
 paid rates awards applicable to the cleaning industry are 
 incorporated as separate parts into the Building Services 
 Award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">' 
 
 
 41 On 16 March 1994, a representative of the applicant announced the memorandum of agreement to Deputy President Acton of the Commission, and sought the making of an award in accordance with it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">In the course of his submissions, the applicant's representative told Deputy President Acton: 


 
 'The award that I would be asking that the commission make, arising out of today's proceedings is a minimum rates award, the incidence of which is in similar terms to the incidence of the former Building Services Award of the former Industrial Relations Commission of Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">There will be a second stage in the implementation of this agreement at which time the parties will approach the commission and seek to have the award which we would have made today, amended to incorporate rates of pay which were expressed in the former state awards known as the Building Services State Government Departments and Instrumentalities award, the Miscellaneous Workers Post-secondary Education TAFE Award, and the Cleaners and Domestic Arts Assistance Government Schools Award, and that will be the subject of subsequent application to the commission, and of course there will need to be detailed negotiations between the parties as to the final form of such variations to the award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">' 
 
 
 42 The applicant's representative also told Deputy President Acton that the proposed award reflected the situation as it was when the Building Services Conciliation and Arbitration Board and the Building Services State Government Departments and Instrumentalities Conciliation and Arbitration Board had been restructured by decision of the Industrial Relations Commission of Victoria on 7 March 1991.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">The abolition of those boards by statute in August 1992 led to the introduction into the Building Services (State Government Departments and Instrumentalities) Award of the incidence clause to which I have referred in [36].</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">The Commission made the consent award, which is the 1994 Award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">


 
 43 As had been promised to Deputy President Acton, a further application was made to the Commission to incorporate into the 1994 Award the specific rates derived from several former Victorian awards, including the Building Services (State Government Departments and Instrumentalities) Award .</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">The Commission heard that application on 20 July 1994.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">The application was not opposed by representatives of employers, although two of them expressed concern about differential rates within the industry and foreshadowed discussions with a view to absorbing the specific rates into future general increases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">Commissioner Bacon accepted the submission of the parties and invited them to submit an order for him to make.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">This was the origin of cl 8A of the 1994 Award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">


 
 44 This history might be of some assistance to the respondent's case if there were any evidence that the non-payment of rates specified in the Building Services (State Government Departments and Instrumentalities) Award to those employed as cleaners at the Victorian Arts Centre had ever been the result of a conscious decision not to apply those rates, or an awareness that, for some reason, they were inapplicable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">For present purposes, I am prepared to accept that the construction of an award can be affected by a common understanding of the parties to it about a particular state of affairs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">If such a common understanding existed when the award was made, it should not be departed from when the Court comes to construe the award at a subsequent time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">Care must be taken, however, to distinguish a common understanding from common inadvertence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">If the only reason why the government instrumentality rates were not paid at the Victorian Arts Centre was that neither the union nor the employer adverted to the possibility that there was an obligation to pay them, no common understanding results.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">In order to have an understanding, it is necessary that there be a meeting of minds, a consensus.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">There can be no meeting of minds, no consensus, if no-one has thought about the issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">


 
 45 Such evidence as there is in the present case leads to the conclusion that it is only in recent years that the applicant has realised that there is a possibility that those employed as cleaners at the Victorian Arts Centre have been underpaid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">There were several parties to the memorandum of agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">There is no evidence that any of those parties held a view on the issue at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">In this respect, three significant witnesses gave evidence in this proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">Dimitrios Demos was the Operations Manager of the company that became the contractor for the cleaning of the Victorian Arts Centre from the time the Trust took possession of it in 1981.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">He worked for that company until 1987.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">During that time, he became its State Manager for Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">John Lazzari was the State Manager for Victoria of a predecessor company of the respondent from 1993.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">He had direct responsibility for overseeing the carrying out of the contract to clean the Victorian Arts Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">At the time of the transition from State to federal regulation of terms and conditions of employment in the contract cleaning industry, Mr Lazzari was State President of the Building Services Contractors Association of Australia, which he said was incorrectly described in the memorandum of agreement to which I have referred in [40] as the Property Services Council of Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">In that capacity, he was a signatory of the memorandum of agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">John Grant was on the State Executive of the Building Services Contractors Association of Australia at the time of the transition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">None of these three witnesses gave any evidence suggestive of a common understanding between the applicant or its predecessor and any employer, or employer association involved in the contract cleaning industry, to the effect that the Victorian Arts Centre was not regarded as premises of a State Government instrumentality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">It is clear that no-one adverted to the status of the Trust, and to whether it was a State Government instrumentality for the purposes of either the earlier State award or the 1994 Award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">


 
 46 It is not the case that the applicant has changed its mind and gone back on a common understanding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">It is the case that no common understanding ever existed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">
 Other construction arguments 
 

 
 47 The adoption of a purposive construction of the 1994 Award does not assist the respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">Even if the purpose can be ascertained from the express statements of the subjective intentions of the parties to the process of making the 1994 Award, acceptance that the purpose was to reproduce the situation as it had been in Victoria does not answer the question whether there existed an obligation to pay the government instrumentality rates to those employed as cleaners at the Victorian Arts Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">The stated purpose of the memorandum of agreement was to preserve rates of pay 'as they were prescribed'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">If it could be shown that some provision of the earlier Victorian award excluded those employed to clean the premises of the Trust, the stated purpose of the memorandum of agreement would not be fulfilled if the 1994 Award, which was the result of the agreement expressed in the memorandum of agreement, were to be construed as including the Trust's premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">No such provision existed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">On no view can an examination of cl 8A(a)(ii) of the 1994 Award, by itself or in the context of other provisions of the 1994 Award, yield a purpose as specific as the exclusion of the Trust from the concept of a State Government instrumentality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">The purpose was to provide higher rates of pay for those employed in cleaning in the premises of 'State Government Departments and Instrumentalities'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">The question remains whether that concept includes or excludes the Trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">


 
 48 Counsel for the respondent also attempted to argue that the phrase 'State Government Departments and Instrumentalities' had become a term of art in relation to industrial instruments operating in Victoria by the time the 1994 Award was made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">To establish this proposition, he tendered a copy of the original print of the Metal Industry (Victorian Government Departments and Instrumentalities) Interim Award 1981 ('the Metal Industry Award'), dated 14 October 1981.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">Clause 2 of the Metal Industry Award provided: 


 '2 --- PARTIES BOUND 
 
 This award shall be binding upon members of The Amalgamated Metal Workers' and Shipwrights Union, Australasian Society of Engineers, the Electrical Trades Union of Australia, The Federated Ironworkers' Association of Australia and the Victorian Government Departments and Instrumentalities named hereunder in respect of their employees performing work covered by this award.</sentence>

<sentence id="s194">
 Housing Commission, Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">
 Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">

 In Part 3: 
 
 Geelong Harbour Trust Commissioners.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">
 Port of Melbourne Authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">
 Portland Harbour Trust Commissioners.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">' 
 
 
 49 Just how the making of the Metal Industry Award could operate to create a term of art for industrial instruments is unclear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">The organisations that later amalgamated to form the applicant were not parties to the Metal Industry Award, and therefore played no part in the choice of bodies named.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">Mr Lazzari, who was a signatory to the memorandum of agreement referred to in [40], gave evidence that he was not aware of the list in the Metal Industry Award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">It is unlikely that the concept of a State Government department or instrumentality could be frozen in time by a specific listing in one award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">In any event, the list included 'Her Majesty the Queen In Right of the State of Victoria', an entity apt to include all statutory bodies entitled to the immunity of the Crown in right of the State of Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">On the basis that the Trust is such a body, it would be comprehended by the list in the Metal Award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">


 
 50 Although three witnesses with long experience of the contract cleaning industry gave evidence on behalf of the respondent, no witness gave evidence to the effect that the phrase 'State Government Departments and Instrumentalities' had become a term of art in the industry, whether as a result of the Metal Industry Award or otherwise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">


 
 51 Counsel for the respondent attempted to rely on the capitalisation of the initial letter of the word 'Instrumentalities' in each of cl 8A(a)(ii) of the 1994 Award and cl 15.3.1(b) of the 2003 Award, as well as in the earlier Victorian award, as indicative that a particular meaning of the word had been intended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">Capitalisation of the initial letters of words in headings is a common practice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">Inappropriate capitalisation of the initial letters of words, when not used in headings, is also common.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">It is unlikely to indicate the use of a term of art.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">In any event, if a conscious decision had been made to use the word 'Instrumentalities' as a term of art, the option of defining it in the award was available.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">It is unlikely that whoever drafted the 1994 Award made a conscious decision to use a term of art, and to indicate that a term of art had been used solely by the use of an initial capital letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">I do not accept that the fact that the word 'Instrumentality' has a capital initial in the 1994 Award and the earlier Victorian award that replaced it can be said to be indicative of a term of art.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">This is so, even when the word is contrasted with the word 'instrumentality' in the clause considered by the High Court in the Anti-Cancer Council case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">


 
 52 Counsel for the respondent also attempted to argue that I should have regard to possible anomalies that might arise from the application of cl 8A(a)(ii) of the 1994 Award and cl 15.3.1(b) of the 2003 Award to high-rise buildings, occupied by a mix of tenants, only some of which were State Government entities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">This argument is completely irrelevant to the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">There is no suggestion that the Victorian Arts Centre is occupied by any entity other than the Trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">The question of multiple occupancy of buildings and the application of cl 8A(a)(ii) of the 1994 Award is dealt with in Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Union v Prestige Property Services Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 408 , a judgment delivered subsequent to the hearing of the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">


 
 53 For these reasons, I am persuaded that the word 'Instrumentalities' when used in the composite phrase 'State Government Departments and Instrumentalities' in cl 8A(a)(ii) of the 1994 Award and cl 15.3.1(b) of the 2003 Award is used in its ordinary and natural meaning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">When so used, as I have already found, it encompasses the Trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">
 Conclusion and orders 
 

 
 54 It follows that the respondent has been in breach of its obligations, imposed by cl 8A(a)(ii) of the 1994 Award and cl 15.3.1(b) of the 2003 Award, to pay the allowances required by those clauses to its employees engaged in performing cleaning services at the Victorian Arts Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">


 
 55 Section 178(2) of the WR Act provides that multiple breaches of a term of an award, arising out of a course of conduct, are to be treated as a single breach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">Counsel for the applicant accepted that all breaches of the 1994 Award were to be treated as a single breach and all breaches of the 2003 Award were to be treated as another single breach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">This involves the concession that each of the relevant clauses contains a single 'term', for the purposes of s 178 of the WR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">I am prepared to accept this concession in the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">


 
 56 The maximum penalty applicable is $10 000 for each breach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">There has been an increase in the maximum amount, by amendment to the WR Act since the proceeding was commenced, but counsel for the applicant conceded that the earlier maximum is the appropriate one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">In fixing the appropriate penalty, I bear in mind that the real penalty for the respondent will be the necessity to make the payments of underpaid entitlements, together with interest, to each of the employees underpaid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">This will be an expensive exercise for the respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">It will have an effect on the profitability of the contract under which the respondent is responsible for the cleaning of the Victorian Arts Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">I accept that that contract was negotiated without regard to the need to pay the allowances specified by the 1994 Award and the 2003 Award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">Some reference was made to the possibility of renegotiating the contract in light of the outcome of this proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">Whether that can be done, and the Trust can be induced to pay a greater sum in respect of work already done, I do not know.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">I also accept that, at least until recent times, the breaches have arisen from inadvertence, and not from a deliberate intention to underpay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">No suggestion was made that the respondent had a record of prior breaches of awards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">The only aggravating factor appears to be the want of any contrition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">In his evidence, Mr Lazzari was very dismissive of the claim, describing it as 'frivolous'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">Obviously, there was a need for the respondent to look more closely at its obligations, when the issue was first raised by the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">


 
 57 It is also necessary to acknowledge the need for deterrence in an industry in which Mr Grant, who has held several offices in the Building Services Contractors Association over a long period, acknowledged that there is some non-compliance with awards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">


 
 58 Taking all these factors into account, it is appropriate to fix the penalty at $2000 in respect of the breach of the term of the 1994 Award and $1500 in respect of the breach of the term of the 2003 Award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">The usual order is that a penalty be paid to the party seeking its imposition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">There was no submission that such an order would be inappropriate in the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">Pursuant to s 356 of the WR Act, there will be an order that each penalty be paid to the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">


 
 59 I also propose to make an order that the respondent pay to each of the persons it employed at the Victorian Arts Centre the amount agreed to be outstanding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">To each amount there should be added interest, pursuant to s 179A of the WR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">In this respect, the applicant's claim is modest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">Because of the difficulty of calculation of interest when it is payable on a series of payments that were due over a long period, the applicant has asked for interest only from 1 June 2003, ie.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">on the total sum owed to each employee in respect of the two periods claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">The applicant calculated that interest only up to the date when the case was being heard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">It should be calculated to the date of judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">As to the rate, the applicant sought interest at 11 per cent per annum, that being the operative rate at 1 June 2003, pursuant to the Penalty Interest Rate Act 1983 (Vic).</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">It is appropriate to choose that rate for the reasons advanced in EMCL Pty Ltd v Esanda Finance Corporation Ltd (No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">2) (1998) 160 ALR 382 at 384, and Textile, Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia v Givoni Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 1406 at [91] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">The rate of interest was increased to 11.25 per cent from 26 June 2003, and to 12 per cent from 1 July 2004, but counsel for the applicant forwent any entitlement to a rate greater than 11 per cent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">The order that I make for payment to each employee will therefore include an amount of interest on the sum owing to that employee at 1 June 2003, at the rate of 11 per cent per annum (non-compounding), from 1 June 2003 to the date of judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">


 
 60 The case is covered by s 347 of the WR Act, so no question of cost arises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">

1 On 18 November 2005 I published reasons for judgment in this proceeding; see Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing &amp; Allied Services Union of Australia v ACI Operations Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1662.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">On that day the Court ordered the reinstatement of Mr Colin Williams and deferred consideration of penalty and compensation pending the receipt of written submissions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">These reasons for judgment should be read together with the reasons for judgment published on 18 November 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">Penalty 
 
2 The following observations made in the previous judgment are relevant to penalty:
 
 &#8226; Mr Pillen's refusal to accept the existence of a dispute; [16]
 &#8226; The decision to conduct the stop work meeting at the time it was held arose from Mr Pillen's refusal to acknowledge the existence of a dispute; [17]
 &#8226; It would have been more appropriate, notwithstanding the above point, to hold the meeting at lunchtime; [53]
 &#8226; The "overbearing and provocative" manner in which Mr Minniti spoke to Mr Williams; [24]
 &#8226; The different treatment accorded to other employees who had taken strike action but were not disciplined; [29], [43]
 &#8226; The failure to engage the disciplinary code suggested strongly that Mr Gillholme and Mr Minniti were keen to be rid of Mr Williams; [37]
 &#8226; That Mr Williams' status as team coordinator did not affect the decision to terminate him; [38], [43]
 &#8226; The breach of s 298K of the Act was blatant and serious; [51], [71]
 &#8226; "ACI desired to be rid of Mr Williams, who it saw as an active shop steward ... who had given it some grief on industrial issues.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">" [52] 

3 Counsel for ACI submitted that the decision to terminate Mr Williams was made in response to what Mr Gillholme and Mr Minniti understood was Mr Williams' conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">Counsel also contended that it was action which Mr Gillholme and Mr Minniti believed they were entitled to take under the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The decision was opportunistic and not premeditated, counsel submitted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">4 Even if it is accepted that the decision was an opportunistic one, it was nonetheless unlawful and, in the circumstances set out in the previous judgment, it constituted a blatant and serious breach of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">I do not accept the submission that the termination of Mr Williams flowed from a failure to appreciate the scope of s 298L(1)(a).</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">Mr Gillholme and Mr Minniti are both experienced in industrial relations.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">They should not have been in any doubt about the illegality of their conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">5 I reject the contention that Mr Minniti's reaction to Mr Williams' putting the telephone down showed that Mr Minniti was merely reacting to provocation rather than acting in deliberate defiance of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">Mr Minniti had the opportunity to put a considered recommendation to Mr Gillholme.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">The recommendation was not a spur of the moment decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">6 Mr Williams' failure to hold the meeting at lunchtime should be considered as only a minor mitigating factor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">To class it as a major mitigating factor would reward Mr Pillen's even more inappropriate conduct in failing to accept the existence of a dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">7 I further reject the submission that Mr Williams' status as team co-ordinator was "an ameliorating circumstance".</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">Such a contention is inconsistent with the reasons for judgment of 18 November 2005, in which the Court found that Mr Williams' status as a team coordinator was not a basis for his termination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">8 I agree with the submission of counsel for ACI that the Court should not take into account the breach of the disciplinary code, in itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">However, as counsel for the Union submitted, adherence to the code may have avoided the situation which ACI now finds itself in as a result of its summary dismissal of Mr Williams.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">9 An examination of the relevant facts shows that two senior industrial relations managers, in important roles, made a decision to terminate the employment of an active shop steward, whose industrial representation of the members of the Union working at ACI had displeased them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">In the circumstances, a penalty in the high range of those available is appropriate, but for the matters set out below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">10 I now turn to the other factors relevant to the question of penalty as discussed by Branson J in Construction, Forestry, Mining &amp; Energy Union v Coal &amp; Allied Operations Pty Ltd (No 2) (1999) 94 IR 231, as foreshadowed at [79] in the previous judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">11 There is no evidence that ACI has previously contravened Pt XA of the Act, or any predecessor provision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">That is a mitigating factor.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">12 Given that Mr Williams has been reinstated and that ACI has been admonished for its conduct in the 18 November 2005 judgment, there are no continuing consequences in respect of ACI's conduct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">13 The protection of industrial freedom of association and, in this case, freedom of representation, has been upheld by the reinstatement order.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">14 The maximum penalty available to the Court is 300 penalty units or $33,000, see s 298U(a)(i) of the Act and s 4AA(1) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth).</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">15 Having regard to the totality of the above matters I consider that a mid-range penalty is appropriate and set the penalty at $16,500.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">16 There is no reason why the penalty should not be paid to the Union; see Finance Section Union v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [2005] FCA 1847 at [71] , per Merkel J and s 356(b) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Compensation 
 
17 The Union does not currently press for an order for the payment of compensation to Mr Williams.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">Counsel for the Union informed the Court that ACI has, since 18 November 2005, agreed to make adjustments necessary to ensure Mr Williams' financial position is restored.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">However, counsel noted that the agreement between the parties had not been fully implemented and submitted that the Court should defer consideration of compensation to allow the agreement to be implemented.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">18 It is preferable to allow sufficient time to elapse to permit the parties' agreement to take effect.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">I will place the onus on the Union to re-agitate this issue within 28 days of these reasons for judgment, failing which there will be no order made under s 298U(c) concerning compensation and the file will be closed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">Should the Union wish to re-agitate this issue the Court will convene a directions hearing at 10.15 am on 14 March 2005 to deal with that aspect of this proceeding.</sentence>

<sentence id="s0">
 The circumstances of the applicants to the present dispute and the nature and implications of their business and operational activities relevant thereto 
 
1 The first applicant, WorldAudio Limited ('WAL'), is a public company listed on the Australian Stock Exchange, having approximately 1200 ordinary shareholders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">Its principal business is the sale of broadcast airtime to advertisers, per medium of commercial radio broadcasting services, at some 50 locations around Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">The second applicant AusCoast Broadcasting Pty Limited ('AusCoast') is a wholly owned subsidiary of WAL and has been since February 2002, when WAL acquired the total AusCoast shareholding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">AusCoast holds a Medium Frequency Narrowband Area Service ('MF NAS') radiocommunications apparatus licence issued under s 100(1) of the Radiocommunications Act 1992 (Cth) ('the Act'), being licence number 1130030 (the '1620 licence').</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Broadly speaking, it is in the nature of a transmitter licence , in contrast to a receiver licence , those being the two types of apparatus licence available under s 97 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">In turn, there are several types of transmitter licences provided for by the Act, the 1620 licence being described by the applicants as 'a broadcasting license type'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">A ' broadcasting station ' is defined by s 5 of the Act to mean:
 
 'a transmitter that is operating for the purposes of: 
 
 
 (a) a broadcasting services bands licence; or 
 (b) the provision of a national broadcasting service within the meaning of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (Cth)'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">
 
 
 

2 WorldAudio Communications Pty Limited ('the Broadcaster'), being a further subsidiary of WAL, holds an Australia-wide commercial radio broadcasting licence under s 40 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (Cth), being licence No 1170227.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">That legislation does not fall for scrutiny in the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">The broadcasting services of the Broadcaster are presently transmitted in the Brisbane area by AusCoast under the auspices of the 1620 licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">For convenience, and in line with the applicants' written submissions, those services transmitted in the Brisbane area are hereafter referred to as 'the broadcasting service'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">An independent engineering report prepared for WAL by THL Australia Pty Ltd, said by the applicants to be one of Asia Pacific's leading broadcast engineering groups, was to the effect that the 1620 licence provides a signal of 'superior listening quality' to 1,150,065 persons in the Brisbane area, and of so-called 'acceptable listening quality' to a further 882,596 persons in the Brisbane area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">3 The statutory scheme for licensing the use of spectrum under the Act has been administered by the respondent Australian Communications and Media Authority ('the Authority' or 'ACMA'), and its precursor the Australian Communications Authority, since 1 July 1997.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">Prior to that time, the administration of licensing was undertaken by the Spectrum Management Agency.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">Nothing turns however on those changes in identity of the administering authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">The statutory scheme contains provisions, in addition to the issue of apparatus licences, in relation to the duration of apparatus licences (s 103), the general conditions of apparatus licences (s 107), additional conditions of apparatus licences (s 108), changes to conditions of apparatus licences (s 111), the making of guidelines that the Authority is to apply in exercising its powers under sections 107, 108 and 111 (s 112), the suspension or cancellation of apparatus licences (ss 126 and 128 ), the renewal of apparatus licences (s 130) , and the transfer of apparatus licences (ss 131AA and 131AB).</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">4 One of the conditions of the 1620 licence, apparently imposed from the time of its first issue, is that the location of the transmitter be 170 Kingsley Terrace, Manly, being a suburb of Brisbane; that site was referred to in the course of the proceedings as the 'condition site'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">That condition was imposed pursuant to s 107(1)(g) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">Other conditions relate to various technical aspects of the radiocommunications transmission authorised by the licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">In spite of that condition, transmission of the broadcasting service has never occurred in any physically operative sense from that site at Manly, that is, from the condition site, at least for the reason that the condition site is located within an established residential area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">The broadcasting service is presently transmitted from a different location in the Brisbane area, being 320 Fleming Road, Tingalpa, which is 5.7 kilometres distant from the condition site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">That site at Tingalpa is sometimes referred to in the parties' submissions as the 'current site', in contrast to the 'condition site' at Manly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">The effect of the purported decision of the respondent Authority, the subject of the present review application, which was made on 30 June 2005 and affirmed on 18 August 2005, is that AusCoast is not officially authorised to transmit the broadcasting service, or any other radiocommunications service, from the current site, without breaching the locational condition of the 1620 licence referrable to Manly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">That prohibition, if enforced, would apparently mean that the broadcasting service of the Broadcaster must cease to be transmitted in the Brisbane metropolitan area.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">So much would occasion substantial loss and damage, both directly and indirectly, as the applicants understandably emphasised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">5 As I have already indicated, there is not, nor has there ever been, any radiocommunications transmitter located at the condition site at Manly, that site being located within a residential area of Brisbane and itself comprising residential premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">When application was originally made by AusCoast for the 1620 licence, it appears that the condition site at Manly was used by AusCoast as the nominal location site for the 1620 licence because of an inability of AusCoast to identify a suitable location elsewhere for transmission of its broadcasting service to Brisbane, pending proper planning for transmission of radio communications under that licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">The adoption of that course of purported expediency was said by Mr Thompson, the chief executive officer of WAL, to accord with the then practice of administrative convenience in operation at that time in respect of applications for and adoption of transmitter licences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">As I have foreshadowed, that practice was said to allow an applicant for a MF NAS apparatus licence to identify a convenient address for the transmission site referrable to the applicant's licence, pending completion of comprehensive planning for transmission of radiocommunications under the licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">In fact an application appears to have been made by AusCoast for the change of the transmission site from Manly to another site in the Brisbane locality as far back as 12 November 1996, it being doubtless considered that it would be highly unlikely that the necessary town planning approval could ever be obtained to operate the 1620 licence from within the Manly residential area, owing to the environmental implications that might have ensued to an area of land so zoned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">A precedent for that practice was identified by the applicants as the MF NAS apparatus licence for Hobart, which was listed nominally by reference to the site of the Hobart Fire Station, even though such location could not constitute a radiocommunications site in any operational physical sense for radio interference reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">6 On 29 August 2003, the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (the 'Minister') issued Australian Communication Authority Direction (MF NAS Transmitter Licences) Direction No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">1 of 2003, the practical effect of which was contended by the applicants to be that the holders of MF NAS apparatus licences, such as AusCoast, would not be permitted to transmit a commercial radio broadcasting service under a licence of that designation, unless the service was provided by 29 August 2004 (ie within one year later).</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">7 AusCoast commenced transmission of the subject broadcasting service on 5 November 2003 from the current site at 320 Fleming Street, Tingalpa, in alleged satisfaction of the Minister's direction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">It appears that the transmission of the subject broadcasting service of AusCoast has thereafter continued unabated from the Tingalpa site, and there further appears to have been no complaint communicated to any of the parties to the proceedings, including the Authority, as to AusCoast's transmission of its broadcasting service from the Tingalpa site having caused any interference to any other radiocommunication transmission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">8 It was the applicants' further case that the current site is an established radiocommunications transmission site, and that its utilisation by AusCoast for that purpose has complied with all relevant town planning, local government and environmental laws, whereas the condition site remains as I have already indicated within a residential area, in relation to which it is highly unlikely any corresponding requisite approvals could ever be obtained in relation thereto; for one matter, there is a block of residential units standing in the immediate vicinity of the Manly transmission site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">It was therefore that on 6 August 2004, AusCoast applied to the then relevant authority to change the site condition of the 1620 licence from its nominal location in Manly to its operative broadcasting site at Tingalpa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">In the course of the communications which ensued, the Authority alleged that the broadcasting service being provided, in effect under the auspices of the 1620 licence, was being operated in breach of licence conditions, by virtue of transmission occurring from a site otherwise than that stated in the condition to the licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">9 On receipt of that application of 6 August 2004, the Authority responded by fax of 16 August 2004 to the effect that any such variation of the site condition in respect of the 1620 licence was not acceptable, for the reason that it '... would put the station closer to an adjacent [channel] service on 1611kHz at Tingalpa and less than 30km from an adjacent channel service on 1629kHz at Mango Hill ... [and the transmission site] would be closer to a co-channel service at Toowoomba.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">' Of course there existed a degree of artificiality in relation to the expression '... place the transmitter closer...', the placement of the transmitter apparatus being already physically located at Tingalpa, and having never been physically located at Manly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">10 I should perhaps incorporate reference to further terminologies, practices and policies appearing in the evidence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">A 'co-channel service' is another service broadcasting at the same frequency whereas an 'adjacent channel service' would be one broadcasting at either of the two frequencies each side of the subject apparatus licence, namely 1611 kHz and 1629 kHz in the present circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">The use of the expression 'closer' by the Authority's officer in the fax of 16 August 2005 is a reference to the application of the so-called '30/160 rule' which rule is enumerated in two policy documents of the Authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">The first document is a 'Business Operating Procedure' entitled 'Licensing Narrowband Area Service stations' ('NAS BOP') and the second document is a 'policy information paper' entitled 'Apparatus Licensing --- Narrowband Area Service stations' ('NAS PIP').</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">In effect, those policies stipulate a minimum separation distance between MF NAS transmitters on co-channel frequencies of 160 kilometres and for adjacent channels of 30 kilometres.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">Since in the past the enforcement of those minimum separation distances has not always been strict on the part of the Authority (or its predecessors), it has also formulated the 'make it better rule', whereby suggested variations in site location that do not satisfy the '30/160 rule', but which are an improvement on the status quo in terms of the distances between transmission services, may be approved.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">11 Subsequently by letter dated 5 October 2004 a further Authority communication informed WAL inter alia that its application dated 6 August 2004 to relocate the 1620 licence had 'not been finalised' because '... the site co-ordinates that you provided do not meet, or improve, co-channel separation distances'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">Interestingly in the light of the Authority's present submissions, the author of the letter then went on to request 'within one month of today, additional site co-ordinates information and/or details of how [WAL] propose to regularise the operation of [the 1620 licence]', and said that 'this correspondence is to be taken as a request for additional information for the purposes of s 286 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">' That requested information was apparently provided to the Authority by WAL in a letter dated 27 October 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">By letter of 15 November 2004, the Authority acknowledged WAL's ongoing efforts to resolve its site difficulties, but indicated nevertheless that the broadcasting service was operating 'in breach of licence conditions'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">No express mention was apparently made in that correspondence of 15 November 2004 to WAL's 'application...to relocate [the 1620 licence]', as that application was described in the Authority's earlier letter of 5 October 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">12 Two file notes authored by respective officers of the Authority evidence telephone discussions apparently undertaken by those same officers of the Authority with Mr Thompson of WAL in late 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">In both of those file notes, the Authority's officers claim to have impressed upon Mr Thompson that the Authority 'had already considered the matter [of the variation of the site condition on the 1620 licence]' and had 'arrived at its current position'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">On the second occasion Mr Thompson was apparently invited to make another request in writing, which he duly did by letter dated 13 December 2004.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">That letter sought both the relocation of the 1620 licence to the Tingalpa site but also the revocation of MF NAS apparatus licence number 1402943 ('the 1611 licence'), which had as its site condition a location also in Tingalpa some 7.5 kilometres away from AusCoast's current transmission site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">13 At this point of the narrative of material circumstances, I would revert back in time to 27 February 1996, being some five months after the issue originally of the 1620 licence to AusCoast.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">At that time in 1996, so the applicants pointed out, the 1611 licence was registered in the name of Queensland Hospital Radio Association.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">The site of the 1611 licence shown in records maintained by the Authority is presently recorded as Bracken Ridge Reservoir.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">Until January 2005, the 1611 licence, that being of course to be distinguished from the applicants' 1620 licence, had a different site location, recorded as being in Tingalpa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">However by about the commencement of 2005, a change to the present 1611 licence site at Bracken Ridge Reservoir was approved by the Authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">The Bracken Ridge Reservoir site is 21063 kilometres distant from the condition site at Manly, and 18.291 kilometres distant from the current site at Tingalpa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">Yet the 1611 licence is inoperative and has never operated, so the applicants maintained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">Those circumstances were raised by the applicants by way of apparent exemplification of at least the alleged elasticity of administration and operation of the Act relevantly to the nomination of site locations of licensees for convenience until an appropriate transmitter site can be found.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">The fact that the 1611 licence had issued some five months after the 1620 licence was said to be explanatory of the request made by WAL to the Authority for the revocation of the 1611 licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">That request, and the events occasioning it, are not of course directly relevant to the present proceedings, but provides potentially relevant background to the principal case of the applicants to be presented, in the event that the applicants are successful in the present interlocutory dispute.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">14 Further discussions and communications have ensued between WAL and the Authority concerning the possibility of AusCoast continuing to transmit from Tingalpa, in circumstances which nevertheless were described on behalf of the Authority as already involving breach of licence conditions, though pending resolution of what an officer of the Authority described as AusCoast's attempts to acquire another licence located at Tingalpa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">By letter dated 23 December 2004, the Authority purported to 'reiterate its advice to [WAL] of 26 August 2004 that [the Tingalpa site] is unsuitable because it does not meet co-channel or adjacent channel re-use distances for a number of services...'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">Next followed a description of the respective services which were said by the Authority to render the request for variation of the site location to involve breach of the Authority's policy on technical requirements.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">There followed on 14 February 2005 a written request from WAL's solicitors to the Authority to make a decision under s 111 of the Act concerning a condition of the 1620 licence, being that the site of that licence be changed from Manly to Tingalpa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">Critical to the present proceedings is the Authority's correspondence of 30 June 2005, which, after describing the relevant policies and expressing the effect of the proposed relocation on separation distances between the transmission under the 1620 licence and those nearby, was relevantly in the following terms:
 
 '...the [Authority] will not exercise its discretionary power under section 111 of the [Act] and vary the licence conditions in the terms proposed by [WAL]... 
 
 [S]ection 111 confers a power on the [Authority] to unilaterally impose, revoke or vary licence conditions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">In this way, the only "decision" contemplated by the section is one that will some way change the licence conditions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">If there is no change to the licence conditions, then for section 111 purposes, no decision has been made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">It follows from this that it is only where the [Authority] decides to impose, revoke or vary conditions that a review can be sought under the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">
 
 In this case the [Authority] has not made a decision to change the licence conditions so a reviewable decision has not been made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">' 
 

The first issue arising in the present interlocutory dispute is whether that communication was a decision ... made... under an enactment for the purposes of s 3(1) of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) ('ADJR Act').</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">It is that issue which is addressed by these reasons for judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">
 

15 WAL subsequently requested reconsideration of the Authority's refusal to vary the licence site condition, doing so purportedly pursuant to s 285(g) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">WAL also sought from the Authority a statement of its reasons for decision pursuant to s 13 of the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">Both of those requests were refused by the Authority in correspondence of 18 August 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">In that correspondence, the Authority reiterated its view that 
 
 '...section 111 of the Act confers a power on [the Authority] to impose, revoke or vary licence conditions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">[The Authority] has not exercised its power under section 111 to impose, revoke or vary licence conditions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">There is therefore no decision under the Act for [the Authority] to reconsider under section 285 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">' 

In respect of WAL's request for a statement of reasons, the Authority said:
 
 'the decision not to vary the licence condition of [the 1620 licence] is not a decision made under the [Act].</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">The [ADJR Act] applies to decisions made under an enactment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">As there has not been any such decision, this request for a statement of reasons is refused.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">' 
 

16 It is further in issue in the present interlocutory proceedings whether the Authority's refusal to reconsider its decision pursuant to s 285 of the Act, and to provide a statement of reasons for its decision of 30 June 2005, amounted to decision[s] ... made ... under an enactment for the purposes of the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">The applicants' reasons for the intervention of curial relief and the nature of the relief sought 
 
17 It is largely in the context I have already described that what the applicants contend to have been the primary decision of the Authority made adversely to the applicants on 30 June 2005, being a decision followed by the Authority's subsequent refusal to reconsider that earlier decision pursuant to s 285(g) of the Act, or to provide reasons for it, have become the subject of an application for review under both the ADJR Act, and contemporaneously also under s 39B(1A) of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) (' Judiciary Act ').</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">The applicants' apprehension is that the practical effect of the decisions of the Authority under review is that their present broadcasting service under the auspices of the 1620 licence must cease to be provided to the Brisbane area, there being apparently no other means by which the applicants could cause their subject broadcasting service to be transmitted to the numbers of persons in that area presently reached.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">The implications of any such outcome are apparently considered to be as damaging as they are far reaching to the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">18 The applicants' case was that the maintenance of the status quo in relation to the 1620 licence, is vital to WAL's business involving the sale of broadcast airtime to advertisers, and further that the metropolitan area of Brisbane, as the capital city of Queensland, is a vital part of WAL's radio network.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">The provision of the subject broadcasting service under the 1620 licence is a key source of the advertising revenue of WAL.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">That is because when allocating advertising to radio networks, advertising agencies place significant weight on the ability of a network to reach audiences in the three major Eastern seaboard capital cities of Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">Accordingly if WAL is unable to continue to provide a radio network which covers each of those cities, it will be seriously disadvantaged financially when competing in the national radio market, being a market presently embracing at least those three capital cities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">It was asserted that WAL's reputation as a reliable provider of national commercial radio would therefore also be greatly damaged, with a consequentially adverse impact on all remaining markets in which it presently operates, and therefore on its revenues, share price and returns to shareholders.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">19 The Authority's decision primarily the subject of the present application for review, as I have foreshadowed, was communicated to the applicants by letter dated 30 June 2005, being a decision by the Authority not to vary a condition of the 1620 licence by providing that instead of the site of transmission remaining nominally at 170 Kingsley Terrace, Manly, the current site of actual transmission at 320 Fleming Road, Tingalpa be authorised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">That nominated site relocation was not entertained because it was said not to meet the Authority's policy relating to separation distances between transmitters.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">That refusal of site relocation decision, according to the applicants, was made pursuant to s 111 of the Act; however the Authority did not so characterise the same, and hence the Authority did not issue a s 287 notice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">20 Included within the challenge of that decision of 30 June 2005, and hence the subject further of the present administrative review proceedings, are also what the applicants term the Authority's subsequent decisions, each made on 18 August 2005, being not to reconsider its first decision pursuant to s 285(g) of the Act, and also to refuse WAL's request for a statement of reasons for that first decision pursuant to s 13 of the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">The Authority adopted the position that no decision the subject of challenge had been made by it under an enactment, notwithstanding, as the applicants would insist, that a decision of the Authority exercising the discretion conferred by s 111 of the Act would constitute such a decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">21 The basis provided by the applicants in their amended application for being 'aggrieved' by the three respective decisions referred to above, within the meaning of s 5(1) of the ADJR Act, were outlined as follows: 
 
 
 (i) AusCoast is a wholly owned subsidiary of WAL and the holder of the 1620 licence; 
 
 
 
 
 
 (ii) by letter dated 14 February 2005, WAL requested that the site of the 1620 licence be changed from the Manly site to the Tingalpa site; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 (iii) the Authority 'claims that no decision has been made under an enactment and has refused to reconsider the First Decision [ie communicated on 30 June 2005] or to provide a statement of reasons as sought by [WAL].</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">' 
 
 
 

22 The grounds for the applicants' review application were fourfold as follows:
 
 
 (i) the first decision of the Authority on 30 June 2005 involved one or more errors of law, in that: 
 

(a) the Authority misconstrued the NAS PIP Policy (being the policy embodying the so-called '30/160 rule' and the 'make it better rule') by applying the same as if it had the force of law; 
 
(b) the first decision was made in accordance with that policy, being a published policy of the Authority, and was based primarily on the reduction in distance between another radiocommunications transmission site at Mango Hill (apparently conducted by Proma Radio) and the Tingalpa site from 30.7 kilometres to 29.6 kilometres; so much was said by the applicants to involve 'an overly rigid application of the policy, which is a policy and not a statutory rule';
 
 
 (ii) the making of the first decision on 30 June 2005 was an improper exercise of the power conferred by s 111 of the Act, in pursuance of which it was purported to be made, in that: 
 
 
 
 
 (a) the Authority failed to take relevant considerations into account in the exercise of the power, namely the considerations set out in WAL's request for the site of the licence to be changed from Manly to Tingalpa; 
 (b) the Authority exercised its discretionary power in accordance with a rule of policy without regard to the merits of the particular case; 
 
 
 
 
 (iii) the second decision, being the Authority's refusal to reconsider its decision of 30 June 2005, involved an error of law, in that the Authority misconstrued ss 111, 285(f) and 285(g) of the Act;
 (iv) the third decision involved an error of law, in that having regard to the proper construction of ss 111, 285(f) and 285(g) of the Act, the Authority was obliged under s 13 of the ADJR Act to provide WAL with a statement of reasons under that provision in respect of the first decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">
 

23 Those above respective provisions of the Act (of course being the Radiocommunications Act 1992 (Cth) earlier referred to) read, so far as presently material, as follows:
 
 '111 Changes to licence conditions 
 
 
 
 (i) The ACMA may, by notice in writing given to the licensee of an apparatus licence: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) impose one or more further conditions to which the licence is subject; or 
 
 
 
 
 (b) revoke or vary any condition imposed under paragraph (a); or 
 
 
 
 
 
 (c) revoke or vary any condition specified under paragraph 107(1)(g) ... 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (d) if the licence is a transmitter licence, other than a licence issued under section 101A , 102 or 102A or a datacasting transmitter licence --- vary a condition of the kind referred to in paragraph 108(2)(a), (b) or (c).</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">' 
 
 
 
 

(I would mention that s 107 relates to general conditions of an apparatus licence, s 108 to additional conditions for transmitter licences, and ss 101A , 102 and 102A to transmitter licences for particular broadcasting services).</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">
 
 '285 Decisions that may be subject to reconsideration by the ACMA 
 
 
 
 An application may be made to the ACMA for reconsideration of any of the following decisions: 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 
 
 (f) inclusion of conditions in an apparatus licence under paragraph 107 (1)(g) ...; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (g) a decision under section 111 concerning the conditions of an apparatus licence;'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">
 
 
 
 

24 It is appropriate to set out also the text of paragraphs 107(1)(a), (f) and (g):
 
 '107 General conditions 
 
 
 
 (1) An apparatus licence is subject to the following conditions: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) a condition that the licensee, and any person authorised by the licensee to operate a radiocommunications device under the licence, must comply with this Act; 
 
 ... 
 
 (f) such conditions (if any) as the ACMA may determine, by written instrument, in relation to that particular type of apparatus licence; 
 
 (g) such other conditions as are specified in the licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">
 
 ...' 
 
 The Authority's objections to competency and the applicants' contentions in support of competency 
 
25 On 31 August 2005, the Authority filed an amended notice of objection to competency which asserted that the Court lacked jurisdiction to try the application for review brought under the ADJR Act and under s 39B(1A) of the Judiciary Act , on the grounds that the decision purportedly the subject of the proceedings is not a decision made under an enactment nor a matter arising under any laws made by the Parliament.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">The amended notice of objection to competency went on to state '[i]n the alternative if the court determines that it has jurisdiction there is no proper basis upon which to grant relief to the applicant[s]'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">The Authority described this as its 'related alternative motion'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">26 As I have foreshadowed, in support of its objection to competency, in relation to the operation of the ADJR Act in the present circumstances outlined by the applicants, the Authority characterised its decision of 30 June 2005 adversely to the applicants, not as a decision to refuse to change the subject site condition for the 1620 licence of the applicants, but rather as a prior decision to decline to consider whether or not the site condition may be varied at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">It was largely upon that footing that the Authority contended that the initial or prior decision of 30 June 2005 was not a decision made under an enactment, even though a decision involving the exercise of the discretion conferred by s 111 of the Act would seemingly constitute such a decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">The applicants rejoined to the effect that even if that purported distinction was to be taken at face value, the very notion that any such so-called initial or prior decision did not constitute a decision made under the Act immediately encounters forensic and conceptual difficulties.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">The Authority also submitted that the lawfulness of such initial or prior decision was not a ' matter ... arising under any laws made by the Parliament ...' (see s 39B(1A) of the Judiciary Act ), since it was made under a non-legislative policy, being the subject of the NAS PIP and NAS BOP policy documents referred to above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">27 The meaning and implications of the statutory notion of 'decision', where used in the ADJR Act, was comprehensively explained by the High Court in Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">It was emphasised by Mason CJ at 335 (with whose reasons Brennan J agreed, as did Deane J other than in relation to a particular matter not here material) that such meaning must be determined by reference to the text, scope and purpose of the legislation, and further that the remedial nature of the ADJR Act indicates that no narrow view is to be taken of the notion of 'decision' in that statutory context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">Moreover his Honour pointed out at 336 that the concept of 'a reviewable decision is a decision which a statute requires or authorises, rather than merely a step taken in the course of reasoning on the way to the making of the ultimate decision', and further that 'the examples of a decision listed in the extended definition contained in s 3(2) [of the ADJR Act] are also indicative of a decision having the character or quality of finality, [being] an outcome reflecting something in the nature of a determination of an application, inquiry or dispute ...'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">Section 3(3) of the ADJR Act, which extends the statutory definition of 'decision' to '... the making of a report or recommendation before a decision is made in the exercise of a power ', was said by his Honour to operate to '... qualif[y] the characteristic of finality'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">Moreover the Chief Justice explained that '... acts done preparatory to the making of a "decision" are not to be regarded as constituting "decisions" for, if they were, there would be little, if any, point in providing for judicial review of "conduct" as well as of a "decision".</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">'
 
28 In the further course of his reasons for judgment in Bond at 337, Mason CJ pointed out that '... a reviewable "decision" is one for which provision is made by or under a statute', which '... will generally, but not always, entail a decision which is final or operative and determinative, at least in a practical sense, of the issue of fact falling for consideration', so long of course '... that it be a substantive determination', as opposed to 'procedural determinations'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">29 The applicants focused those explanations and expositions of the Chief Justice upon s 111 of the Act, which refers to power conferred upon the Authority inter alia to revoke or vary any condition of a licence which it may have previously imposed, and submitted that so much did not mean that a refusal to exercise any such positive power on the part of the Authority did not constitute a decision made under s 111.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">It was pointed out in that regard, in my opinion rightly, that there are many statutes in which the decision-making power is expressed only in terms of a positive discretion, without express reference to the power to make a decision of a negative character, yet in such cases it is necessarily implicit that a negative decision would also be made under that provision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">Otherwise, so it was further emphasised by the present applicants, paras (a), (b) and (g) of s 3(2) of the ADJR Act would be otiose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">Those subsections read as follows (the emphasis appearing in non-italics is mine):
 
 's 3(2) In this Act, a reference to the making of a decision includes a reference to: 
 
 
 
 (a) making, suspending, revoking or refusing to make an order, award or determination; 
 (b) giving, suspending, revoking or refusing to give a certificate, direction, approval, consent or permission; 
 
 
 ... 
 (g) doing or refusing to do any other act or thing...' 
 

30 In that context of the applicants' discussion of general principles and their operation, I was then referred to the decision of a Full Federal Court in Right to Life Association (NSW) Inc v Secretary, Department of Human Services and Health (1995) 56 FCR 50, where it was held by Lockhart and Beaumont JJ that a decision by the Secretary not to direct that clinical trials of a drug be stopped was a reviewable decision for the purposes of the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">The provision in issue was item 3(e) of Schedule 5A of the Therapeutic Goods Regulations 1990 (Cth), that item being one of a number of conditions to be satisfied for exemption of the drug from the operation of Part 3 of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 (Cth), which condition read as follows:
 
 '(e) the Secretary must not, at any time: 
 
 
 
 
 (i) have become aware that to conduct or continue the trial would be contrary to the public interest; and 
 
 (ii) have directed that the trial not be conducted, or be stopped ...'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">
 
 
 

The appellant Association had requested the Secretary to stop the trials on the ground that they amounted to a breach of NSW and Victorian criminal law, and were thus ' contrary to the public interest '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">The Secretary had then notified the appellant Association and advised that on the evidence available, 'nothing would warrant my acting to stop the trials'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">At 62, Lockhart J observed in relation to that notification as follows:
 
 
 'If the Secretary has reached the opposite conclusion, namely, that to continue the trials would be contrary to the public interest and that a direction should be given to stop them, and thereupon gave that direction, surely that must be a reviewable decision under the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">The sponsor [of the trial] would clearly be a person aggrieved and would in my view be entitled to such a review of the decision under the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">Why should the position be different if the Secretary reaches the opposite conclusion, as he did in this case ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">It was a decision which had "the character or quality of finality"; it was an ultimate or operative decision ...' 
 

Beaumont J, who reached the same decision as Lockhart J, pointed out at 80 that '... the definition of "decision" in s 3(1) of the ADJR Act is not confined to those cases where a duty to make a decision is imposed ...'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">Although he reached a different outcome to the majority, Gummow J's observations at 88 are I think also apposite for consideration in the present circumstances:
 
 
 'It was submitted for the Secretary that s 5(1) of the ADJR Act would be attracted only if conferral of the power to give the direction carried with it a duty upon the Secretary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">It was then submitted that in the case of condition (e) there was no such duty ... 
 
 The submission, in essence, would limit the operation of s 5 of the ADJR Act to decisions in respect of which there was a public duty, performance of which might be required by a writ of mandamus ...</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">This would be contrary to the scheme of the legislation ...' 
 

31 The Authority sought to deny any conclusion as to the existence of a justiciable decision by characterising its first decision as declining to even consider the exercise of any discretion under s 111 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">In the applicants' submission that purported characterisation was misconceived, and must be rejected, for the following reasons:
 
 
 (i) the decision not to exercise its power under s 111 to vary a condition of the licence was indeed final, operative and determinative, in the practical sense described in Bond and in Right to Life [cedilla] of AusCoast's ability to continue to broadcast under the auspices of the 1620 licence from the current site at Tingalpa;
 
 (ii) any such characterisation sits at least uncomfortably with the terms of the Authority's letter of 30 June 2005, containing as it does the assertion '[a]s a result the [Authority] will not exercise its discretionary power under section 111 of the [Act] and vary licence conditions in the terms proposed by [WAL]'; 
 
 
 
 
 
 (iii) the decision not to exercise the power was one which was authorised by and therefore made under s 111 of the Act, since s 111 confers a discretionary power, and hence contemplates that a decision whether or not to exercise that discretion could be made, there being no other source of power for such a decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">
 
 
 

I think that there is force in each of the foregoing submissions of the applicants.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">
 

32 The Authority did not dispute that a refusal to exercise a power may constitute a decision...made...under an enactment , for the purposes of the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">Nevertheless it sought to distinguish Right to Life on the basis that in the circumstances of that case, as opposed to the present case, the decision-maker had purported to consider 'the full gamut...of all the relevant issues'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">The Authority's contention was that its officer in this instance had in effect 'terminated the request [made by WAL for a variation in the site condition of the 1620 licence] at the first hurdle', without considering all of the issues that the Authority would normally take into account in assessing a variation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">I am not persuaded that such contention of the Authority is sound, and that there is in any event any viable difference between the circumstances relevantly in Right to Life and those here prevailing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">In both instances the decision-maker received a request for a decision to be made to a certain effect, and in both instances there was no provision made under the relevant legislation for such requests to be made by formal application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">Moreover in both cases, detailed reasons for that request were given by the entity in favour of the decision it sought to be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">Most importantly for the outcome of this objection to competency, it was put by the applicants that the refusal of the Authority to make a decision in the terms requested by WAL had the practical effect of constituting an ultimate or operative decision, and hence one which bore the character of finality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">The applicants' contentions in relation to what it termed the Authority's second decision made on 18 August 2005 
 
33 It becomes necessary to consider next the implications of the Authority's so-called 'second decision', being that said by the applicants to have been made on 18 August 2005 not to reconsider its first decision of 30 June 2005, to the effect that it would not exercise its discretionary statutory power to alter the condition on the 1620 licence so as to change the site of the licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">The Authority's objection to the Court's competency to review the second decision rested however on its objection to competency of review of the first decision, and was therefore said by the applicants to encounter the same or similar difficulties which I have already described in relation to the first decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">The applicants contended that '[t]he plain words of para 285(g) [of the Act] also tell against the [Authority]'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">34 The opening words to s 285, which I have of course already extracted, but nevertheless merit further emphasis, are that ' [a]n application may be made to [the Authority] for reconsideration of any of the following decisions ', the notion of reconsideration being of wide import.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">Moreover the ensuing language of sub-paragraph (g) includes the word concerning , which was also said by the applicants to be of wide import, such that there could be no contextual reason to construe s 285(g) narrowly.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">Hence the applicants contended on that basis that the Authority's decision not to vary the site condition at the centre of the disputation was clearly a decision concerning the conditions of the 1620 licence, that licence being of course an apparatus licence .</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">35 It was submitted by the applicants moreover that the wording of s 285(g) of the Act should be compared with other sub-paragraphs of s 285.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">I was referred again to s 285(f) which explicitly refers to the inclusion of conditions in an apparatus licence under paragraph 107(1)(g) ...' .</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">So much was said by the applicants 'clearly' to exclude review of a negative decision, that is to say, a decision not to includ[e] the operation of any conditions in an apparatus licence under s 107(1)(g), which statutory expression is used in marked contrast to what appears in s 285(g), which was described by the applicants as covering 'both positive and negative decisions' by reason of its use in particular of the broad notion of concerning .</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">36 It was further submitted by the applicants that if s 285(g) of the Act was intended to be limited to decisions to give a notice under s 111, the Legislature would have used an expression such as that used in s 285(qa), namely decisions giving a notice .</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">The point was said moreover to be made even more starkly when other sections of the Act are considered, such as s 118, which by para (a) of subs (1) thereof refers to 'a notice under section 111 relating to changes in licence conditions ...'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">The applicants submitted that it would have been a simple matter for the draftsperson to have used that expression in s 285(g) of the Act, had so much been the legislative intention, and further that the difference in expression provided an indication that para 285(g) has a wider operation than the phrase used in s 118(1)(a) of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">There is considerable force in those submissions of the applicants upon the statutory texts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">Outline of the Authority's submissions in support of its objection to competency 
 
37 The Authority's principal contention was that the Act did not impose any duty upon it to consider or act upon requests made by licensees or others to vary the conditions of apparatus licences.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">Instead s 111 of the Act reposed in the Authority a discretionary power to unilaterally vary or revoke conditions of apparatus licences, and s 111 did not provide for a means whereby a licensee could move the Authority to exercise its power under that provision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">The Act was said by the Authority to draw 'a clear distinction' between 'powers in respect of which an application may be made and is necessary and those where no provision is made for an application from an interested person'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">I was referred in that regard to s 286 of the Act, which was said to evidence the former situation, that section reading as follows:
 
 
 's 286 Deadlines for reaching certain decisions 
 
 (1) If this Act provides for a person to make an application to the ACMA for such a decision, the ACMA must make the decision: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) within 90 days after receiving the application; or 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) if the ACMA has, within those 90 days, given the applicant a written request for further information about the application --- within 90 days after receiving that further information.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">' 
 
 
 
 

Subsection (2) provides for a deemed refusal by the Authority, if it has not informed an applicant of its decision within 90 days.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">Where any such application procedure is invoked, it was acknowledged by the Authority that it '... is under a duty to consider the application and indeed, must do so within a prescribed timeframe'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">
 

38 Section 286 appears in Part 5.6 of the Act entitled 'Review of decisions' and follows s 285, which provides for the making of applications to the Authority for reconsideration of the decisions listed in that section.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">Bearing in mind the location of s 286 within Part 5.6 of the Act, the meaning of ' application...for such a decision ' in s 286 must be read as a reference to an application to the Authority for a reconsideration under s 285, and not as a reference generally to any decision of the Authority under the Act for which application can be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">In any event, the absence of any such express 'application procedures' under the Act for the making by the Authority of decisions under s 111 was said by the Authority to imply that it lacked a duty to consider any request or application purportedly made by a licensee under s 111.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">I observe that the Authority did not draw the Court's attention to any species of decision under the Act for which an application procedure exists other than to applications for reconsideration of the decisions listed in s 285.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">39 The Authority next contended that where no application procedure is provided for, as was said to be the case with decisions made under s 111, the Authority may have a discretionary power that can be exercised, such as its power to vary conditions under s 111, but that the Authority would be under no duty to exercise that power, or even to consider whether or not to exercise that power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">Reference was made to two Full Federal Court authorities relating to the operation of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (' Migration Act '), as exemplifications of what was said to be a general principle that the mere existence of a discretionary power does not carry with it a duty to exercise the power, or even to consider whether or not to exercise the same.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">40 It is convenient to consider immediately whether either of those authorities do exemplify or otherwise lend support to that contention of the Authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">WAGJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 227 was concerned with the operation of s 427(1)(d) of the Migration Act , which provided that the Refugee Review Tribunal ('RRT') '... may require the Secretary to arrange for the making of any investigation ... that the Tribunal thinks necessary with respect to the review .</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">' The Full Court in WAGJ (Heerey, RD Nicholson and Mansfield JJ) held that s 427(1)(d) did not impose a duty upon the RRT to consider whether to exercise that power to order an investigation, their Honours placing emphasis upon such statutory words may and Tribunal thinks necessary .</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">I would observe that the Court in WAGJ did not purport to lay down any general principle or rule, their Honours' decision apparently being predicated on the above emphasised words in s 427(1)(d) , and the prevailing legislative context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">The issue arising relevantly in the second of those decisions relied upon by the Authority, being WAJQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 79 , was not concerned with any particular provision of the Migration Act at all, the appellant in that litigation contending that the Tribunal had erred by failing to enquire into the veracity of certain documents and correspondence provided by the appellant in support of his application for a protection visa.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">It is not apparent that the appellant in WAJQ formulated his case by reference to the operation of s 427(1)(d) of that legislation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">The Full Court cited WAGJ as authority for the wider proposition that there is no duty on the RRT to make inquiries, the failure to carry out whereof would give rise to judicial review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">41 I am unable to obtain sufficient assistance from resort to authorities arising in the context of the Migration Act , which has its own terms and conditions for administrative review far removed from those contained in the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">Leaving aside contextual statutory differences, WAGJ and WAJQ do not purport to lay down any principle of general application to the effect that the existence of a discretionary power does not impute a duty to consider whether or not to exercise it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">Nor was either of WAGJ or WAJQ concerned with the meaning of ' decision ... made ... under an enactment ', as that expression appears in the ADJR Act, or otherwise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">42 It was the Authority's further contention that its officers paid due regard to policy formulated by the Authority concerning the location of MF NAS transmitters, and took the view, as they were said by the Authority to be entitled to do, that the proposed relocation advanced by the applicants did not meet the policy requirements apparent in the so-called '30/160 rule', or the 'make it a better rule' apparent in the NAS PIP policy, and that as a consequence, it was decided by the Authority that the applicants' proposal should not be further entertained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">The circumstances of the present case were said by the Authority in that context to be 'broadly analogous' to those considered in a joint judgment of a Full Federal Court (comprising Black CJ, Kiefel and Emmett JJ) in Bedlington v Chong (1998) 87 FCR 75, which was concerned with the operation of ss 48A and 48B of the Migration Act .</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">The Authority relied upon Bedlington for the proposition that it is open to a decision-maker, who is under no duty to consider exercising a discretionary power, to draft a policy which identifies the types of cases in which the exercise of that discretion might be exercised.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">43 Again I am unable to obtain sufficient assistance from resort to authorities involving the application and operation of the Migration Act , which in the case of Bedlington explicitly stipulated that ' the Minister does not have a duty to consider whether to exercise the [power] ... in any ... circumstances '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">The Full Court emphasised at 78 of its reasons for judgment that the particular language of subsection 48B(6) was the sole basis for their decision that the Minister was under no duty in any circumstances to exercise the relevant power under s 48B(1).</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">The critical issue arising was whether the Departmental Secretary was under a duty to bring the application made for the exercise of the power under s 48B(1) to the Minister's attention in order that the Minister could personally determine whether or not to exercise that power.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">Their Honours held that the use of policy guidelines by the Secretary as the basis for refusing to bring the application to the Minister's attention, where such guidelines were specifically intended to identify those cases in which the Minister might consider the exercise of his or her power was valid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">I have considerable difficulty in discerning the availability of assistance from that further authority, given that it relevantly involved a power that the provision required be exercised personally by the Minister, and concerned only the proposition that the Minister had no statutory obligation to make a decision, and again did not occur in an ADJR Act context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">Moreover there is no express provision in the Act (ie the legislation the subject of the present proceedings) to the effect that the Authority need not make any relevant decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">All that discourse put forward by the Authority here in relation to migration cases, in any event, ultimately still begs the question as to whether a decision not to make a decision in a particular context nevertheless constitutes a decision ... made... under an enactment within s 5 of the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">Taken to their logical conclusion, the Authority's submissions appear moreover to run contrary to the warning issued by Gummow J in Right to Life , which I have extracted above, to the effect that limiting the scope of the ADJR Act to decisions in respect of which there was a duty, performance of which might be required by a writ of mandamus would be contrary to the scheme of the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">In that latter regard, I would refer again to the text of s 3(2) of the ADJR Act earlier extracted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">44 In further support of the contention that a decision by an officer to the effect that a request does not fall within an established policy as to which decisions will or will not be entertained, is not a decision...made...under an enactment , the Authority referred me to two additional decisions of this Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">The first was Brownsville Nominees Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 19 FCR 169, where Northrop J held that the Commissioner's refusal to issue an amended assessment under s 170 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) was not subject to review under s 7 of the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">Section 7(1) of the ADJR Act provides for the making of applications for review of the failure of a decision-maker to make a decision where, inter alia , that decision-maker has a duty to make a decision to which [the ADJR Act] applies .</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">Northrop J held at 173 of his reasons for judgment that s 170 did not impose any duty on the Commissioner to make an amended assessment of income tax upon the request of a taxpayer, and thus the application for review of the Commissioner's refusal to issue the amended assessment was not competent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s192">I would observe that the Commissioner's refusal to issue an amended assessment was expressed to the taxpayer in that case in the following terms (at 171):
 
 '...In the circumstances your request to have the subject assessments amended should remain in abeyance pending resolution of the appeal...'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s193">
 

Of course the issue thus arising fell for consideration in the context of the complexity of the code of that legislation as to the circumstances where an amendment to an assessment may be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s194">Brownsville Nominees did not involve the situation of a successful challenge to an assessment of tax by the Australian Tax Office made by a taxpayer, whether formally or informally.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">The Authority contended nevertheless that there was no practical difference between that situation and the present, the Authority simply deciding here not to consider the request for a variation at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s196">
 

45 It is important to bear in mind, in any event, that the applicants have applied for review of the Authority's decision here under s 5(1) of the ADJR Act, and not under s 7 thereof, so that the only question with which I am presently concerned is whether or not the subject decision fulfilled the requirements of s 3(1) of the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s197">In that context I would observe what Lockhart J said at 62 of his reasons for judgment in Right to Life concerning Brownsville Nominees :
 
 'We were referred by counsel for the Secretary to the judgment of Northrop J in [ Brownsville Nominees ] as authority for the proposition that there was no "decision" within the meaning of s 5 of the ADJR Act because there was no duty imposed on the Secretary to make such a decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s198">Brownsville is not authority for that proposition...His Honour's decision was based squarely upon the duties imposed upon the Commissioner under the Assessment Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">' 
 

In similarly rejecting the application of Brownsville Nominees in the manner sought by the Secretary, Beaumont J concluded at 80 of his reasons for judgment that:
 
 'I have difficulty accepting the submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">In the first place, as has been noted, the definition of "decision" in s 3(1) of the ADJR Act is not confined to those cases where a duty to make a decision is imposed, although such decisions are also picked up...'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">
 

Moreover at 88 of his reasons for judgment, Gummow J expressed his agreement with:
 
 '...what [was] said in the reasons for judgment of the other members of the Court as to the inadequacy of [ Brownsville Nominees ] as authority for the proposition that in the present case there could be no decision attracting the ADJR Act unless the Secretary was under a duty to act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">' 
 

I need add nothing further as to the absence of any assistance of Brownsville to the Authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">46 A further authority referred to by counsel for the Authority in the course of argument was Carter v Minister for Aboriginal Affairs [2005] FCA 667.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">In that case, Ryan J held, inter alia , that the Minister's refusal to exercise his power under s 21D(2) of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 (Cth) to make a temporary declaration of preservation was not a decision for the purposes of s 3(1) of the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">47 Subsections 21D(1) and (2) of that particular legislation were in the following terms: 
 
 
 '(1) If a local Aboriginal community decides, whether after an application is made to it or on its own motion, that: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) a place or object in the community area is an Aboriginal place or Aboriginal object; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) that place or object is under threat of injury or desecration; 
 
 
 
 
 
 the community may advise the Minister that it considers a temporary declaration of preservation should be made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">
 
 
 
 
 
 (2) On receiving advice under subsection (1) or determining on his or her own motion that a temporary declaration of preservation should be made, the Minister: 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) shall, within 14 days, cause notice of the advice or determination to be given to any person who is likely to be affected by the making of a declaration; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) shall give any such person an opportunity to be heard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">' 
 
 
 

48 Ryan J found that the Minister there had not received advice from a local Aboriginal community in accordance with s 21D(1), and thus the issue of relevance was whether or not the Minister's decision not to determine[e] on his...own motion that a temporary declaration of preservation should be made was a reviewable decision for the purposes of s 5(1) of the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">The Minister had informed the applicants in writing that he would 'consider' their request for a determination on his own motion, but later told the applicants that he would not do so pending the resolution of another proceeding before this Court involving the same artefacts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">His Honour found that the Minister's decision was a decision to decline to determine[e]...on his own motion and was thus made 'preparatory' to the making of a decision to determine to make a temporary declaration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">Alternatively, his Honour characterised the decision declining to so determine[e] as 'a conclusion reached as a step on the way to an ultimate decision', which is not reviewable, for that reason also, thereby referring to dicta to like effect at 337 of Mason CJ's reasons for judgment in Bond .</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">49 The applicants submitted, in my opinion correctly, that the particular statutory framework addressed in Carter featured a 'staged process of decision-making' whereby before making the ultimate decision of imposing a temporary declaration of preservation , the Minister may make a decision to proceed with such a determination on his or her own motion, such a decision being clearly 'a step along the way'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">By contrast the present legislation (ie the Radiocommunications Act ) features no such stepped or staged decision-making, the power to make the ultimate or operative decision being conferred in its terms by s 111 and relevantly, s 111(1)(c).</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">On that basis at least, Carter is distinguishable from the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">50 The Authority submitted next that a similar conclusion to that which it advocated here was reached by an application of the principles stated by the High Court in Griffith University v Tang [2005] HCA 7 ; (2005) 213 ALR 724.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">The issue there arising was whether the decision of a university to exclude a candidate for a doctorate of philosophy on account of academic misconduct was made under an enactment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">In a majority finding to the contrary of that candidate's complaint, the following appears at [89] in the joint reasons for judgment of Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ to the negative of that proposition (their Honours' emphasis appears in non-italics):
 
 'The determination of whether a decision is "made... under an enactment" involves two criteria: first, the decision must be expressly or impliedly required or authorised by the enactment; and, secondly, the decision must itself confer, alter or otherwise affect legal rights or obligations, and in that sense the decision must derive from the enactment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">A decision will only be "made... under an enactment" if both these criteria are met.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">It should be emphasised that this construction of the statutory definition does not require the relevant decision to affect or alter existing rights or obligations, and it will be sufficient that the enactment requires or authorises decisions from which new rights or obligations arise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">Similarly, it is not necessary that the relevantly affected legal rights owe their existence to the enactment in question.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">Affection of rights or obligations derived from the general law or statute will suffice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">' 
 

Purportedly in the light of that dicta , the Authority contended that its '... decision not to entertain [WAL's] request, however it be characterised, did not confer, alter or otherwise affect legal rights', but '... left them precisely as they were before the applicants requested the [Authority] to exercise its non-compellable discretionary power'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">Even if that analysis of the Authority be correct in terms of the present circumstances of either one or both of the applicants, notwithstanding implications flowing historically from their enjoyment of transmission from the Tingalpa site, it is an analysis which in any event appears to fall short of the foregoing dicta in Griffith University that '... it will be sufficient that the enactment requires or authorises decisions from which new rights or obligations arise'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">I would add that counsel for the Authority conceded during the hearing that Griffith University would be of no assistance to him if I were to find that the Authority had in fact exercised its power under s 111 , as opposed to merely declining to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">At least the Authority's communications with the applicants in 2004 point to the former of those propositions as being the case, as do the Authority's file notes of the same year, as is I think sufficiently apparent from what I have earlier extracted therefrom.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">
 

51 The submissions of the respondent Authority sought to conclude that '[f]or all of these reasons, the decision of the [Authority's] officers was not a decision under an enactment', and was '... not, therefore, a decision to which the [ADJR Act] applies ... [and] [s]imilarly, the lawfulness of the decision is not a matter arising under a law of the Parliament if it were made under a non-legislative policy'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">The Authority did not elaborate on that latter submission.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">However it is clear that it was predicated on the Authority's construction of its decision that was contended by the applicants to be 'highly technical' and 'prefer[ring] form over substance, contrary to the remedial character of the ADJR Act'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">In essence, as I have foreshadowed already, the respondent Authority contended that the 'decision' was nothing more than the refusal of its own officers to consider whether to exercise the Authority's power under s 111 of the Act, that determination having been made by the relevant officers by reference to the policies of the Authority encapsulated in NAS PIP and NAS BOP.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">52 The Authority accepted that '... this Court has jurisdiction under s 39B(1A)(c) of the Judiciary Act to determine whether the [Authority] was under a duty to consider the applicants' request to vary [AusCoast's] licence condition', but asserted that '[n]onetheless, if this Court accepts that the [Authority] was not under such a duty (and remains free from such a duty), the Court would be unable to make an order in the nature of mandamus'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">Absent such an order, so the Authority further submitted, there was no proper basis for any of the relief sought by the applicants', thereby citing Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; ex parte Applicants S134/2002 (2003) 211 CLR 411 at [44]-[48] (Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ) and at [98]-[100] (Gaudron and Kirby JJ), in each such instance containing observations relating to the operation of s 417(1) of the Migration Act , whereby the Minister is empowered to substitute for the RRT's decision a decision more favourable to an applicant for relief, if ' ... the Minister thinks it is in the public interest to do so '.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">Once again I have difficulty in identifying any sufficiency of assistance of authority from a context involving quite different legislation; indeed s 417(7) of the Migration Act at least then explicitly stipulated that ' [t]he Minister does not have a duty to consider whether to exercise the power under subsection (1) in respect of any decision, whether he or she is requested to do so by the applicant or by any other person, or in any other circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">' In any event, as the applicants rightly pointed out, whether or not mandamus might be available against the Authority in relation to the operation of s 111 of the Act, relief pursuant to s 39B(1A) of the Judiciary Act for declaratory relief was sought by the applicants' amended application which Jacobson J accepted for filing in Court on 25 August 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">I have of course earlier referred to the applicants' case for relief being framed on that basis by way of additional or alternative relief to that afforded by the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">53 As to what the Authority referred to as its 'related alternative motion', the Authority contended that since AusCoast is currently broadcasting from premises which are not the premises specified on the conditions of its licence, such conduct was unlawful and improper.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">Accordingly, in case the Court was otherwise minded to entertain a grant of relief following a substantive hearing, it was submitted that relief should be refused as a matter of discretion; since the applicants here seek to protect and validate unlawful and improper conduct, and thereby attract the operation of the maxim of equity 'he who comes into equity must come with clean hands', discussed in R Meagher, D Heydon and M Leeming, Meagher, Gummow and Lehane's Equity Doctrines &amp; Remedies , (4 th ed) at [3-110].</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">The relief presently sought by the applicants is however in the nature of administrative and not equitable relief, the applicants having not purportedly founded any case on equitable estoppel.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">In any event I am of course presently concerned with the Authority's notice of objection to competency.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">The relevance of any such matters so raised by the Authority is limited to the Court's determination of final relief, should the Authority's objection to competency fail wholly or in part.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">54 I should add for completeness that in a short supplementary submission, the Authority repeated the essence of its earlier submissions, and submitted further in the alternative as follows ( inter alia ):
 
 'If the court accepts that there is no duty [for the Authority to consider a request made for a variation of an apparatus licence under s 111] but considers that, nonetheless, the Authority made a decision under s 111, the matter would need to go to a substantive hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">There would then be an argument about whether a reviewable error was made in that legislative context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">There would also be a discretionary issue too.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">' 
 

It is sufficient for me to respond to that supplementary submission at the present stage of the proceedings by referring to the interlocutory decision upon which I have arrived below in the light of the respective submissions of the parties, which have been addressed on the basis of the Authority's objection to competency.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">Conclusions 
 
55 I am of the opinion that the Authority's objection to competency in its presently amended form must be dismissed, for reasons which I have largely foreshadowed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">56 The applicants have rightly contended that the following decisions of the respondent Authority are reviewable by the Court under and pursuant to the provisions of the ADJR Act:
 
 
 (i) the decision of the Authority made on 30 June 2005 under s 111 of the Act not to exercise its power to change the condition on its radiocommunications apparatus licence number 1130030 (called the 1620 licence) granted to AusCoast, such that the site for the operation of that licence be altered from 170 Kingsley Terrace Manly, Brisbane in the State of Queensland to 320 Fleming Road, Tingalpa, Brisbane in that State ('the first decision'); 
 
 
 
 
 
 (ii) the further decision by the Authority made on 18 August 2005 not to reconsider the first decision under s 285(g) of the Act; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 (iii) the further decision by the Authority also made on 18 August 2005 to refuse WAL's request for a statement of reasons for the first decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">
 
 
 

57 I am further of the opinion, to the extent that it may therefore matter, that in so far as the Authority has contended that the subject decisions of the Authority did not arise under any laws made by the Parliament pursuant to s 39B(1A) of the Judiciary Act , that further contention must also fail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">58 It will have been appreciated from observations that I have made in the course of my outline of these reasons for judgment that I would reject the contention of the Authority that its decision-making of 30 June 2005 merely constituted a withholding from consideration of a request of either or both of the applicants to change the site condition of the 1620 licence, whether pursuant to an exercise of a discretionary function or power generally or at large on the Authority's part, or otherwise, and in particular whether by way of exercise of a discretionary power conferred under s 111 of the Act, or otherwise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">The applicants, or at least WAL on behalf of both of them, in substance and in reality, applied unambiguously to the Authority on 6 August 2004 to change the site condition for the subject apparatus licence being a change which the Authority was empowered to implement pursuant to s 111 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">A statutory decision-maker does not avoid the operation of the review provisions of the ADJR Act by purporting to create, whether explicitly or implicitly, a standpoint or position involving a decliner of entry upon statutory decision-making, or for that matter of consideration of decision-making unless the statutory scheme for decision-making so provides (cf Carter ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">So much however is in reality the position or standpoint which the Authority has seemingly endeavoured to adopt and maintain.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">59 Thus by way of reflection of the dictum I have cited from Bond , the communications of the Authority as evidenced from the outset by its faxed response of 16 August 2004 to the applicants' application of 6 August 2004 and thereafter, inclusive of its critical communication to WAL of 30 June 1995, the Authority indicated to the applicants the position which it had adopted or taken as inherently and essentially indicative of decision-making on its part, the same having for instance the 'character or quality of finality', and constituting and involving 'an outcome reflecting something in the nature of a determination of an application' within the scope of that dictum of Mason CJ in Bond I have earlier cited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">That communication of the Authority constituted or involved a decision 'at least in a practical sense, of the issue of fact falling for consideration'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">It was 'a substantive determination' as opposed to a 'procedural determination', to adopt the Chief Justice's further dictum in Bond .</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">60 Moreover by way of reflection of dicta I have cited from Right to Life , and in particular from that of Lockhart J at 62, I would characterise the Authority's conduct culminating in its faxed response of 30 June 2005 as similarly indicative of a conclusion having been reached by the Authority in or to the effect of the first decision postulated in the applicants' amended application filed in Court on 25 August 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">The Authority made thereby a decision under s 111 not to effect a variation to one of the conditions it had imposed on the 1620 licence pursuant to s 107(1)(g) of the Act, namely the condition stipulating the transmission site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">The Authority's communication of 30 June 2005 constituted or involved moreover the very opposite or antithesis of the decision which the applicants had been seeking from the Authority, commencing from WAL's application of 6 August 2004 made to the Authority, being a decision the implications and consequences whereof clearly and in substance affected rights and obligations of the applicants concerning the 1620 licence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">61 It follows in my opinion that the Authority's objection to competency must fail, at least for the reason that such objection is founded on the erroneous proposition that no decision has been relevantly made under an enactment, pursuant to s 3(1) of the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">Whilst that conclusion renders unnecessary any conclusion to be reached as to whether a matter relevantly arose under any law made by the Parliament for the purpose of the operation of s 39B(1A) of the Judiciary Act , I am unable to identify any viable basis in favour of a negative response to that latter proposition of the applicants as well.</sentence>
<sentence id="s258">It is moreover not accurate for the Authority to contend that its refusal was a decision made pursuant to a policy as opposed to an enactment, any resemblance here to the factual situation prevailing in Bedlington being merely chimerical, for the reasons that I have indicated above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s259">62 It follows from my foregoing conclusions that the Authority's refusal to vary the 1620 licence site condition involves a matter arising under a law made by Parliament of the Commonwealth, the legislative authority to make that decision being conferred by s 111 of the Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s260">Accordingly I would further find that the purported ground of objection pleaded by the Authority in the alternative, namely that '... there is no proper basis upon which to grant relief to the applicant', must also fail, owing to the availability at least of declaratory relief to the applicants for the reasons I have earlier explained.</sentence>
<sentence id="s261">63 Accordingly the application for review of the first decision sought by the applicants' amended application filed in Court on 25 August 2005 must proceed to a final hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s262">64 It follows moreover, in the light of all of my foregoing findings, that the further applications to review the Authority's decision of 18 August 2005 not to reconsider its prior principal decision of 30 June 2005, and also the Authority's yet further decision made at the same time to refuse WAL's request for a statement of reasons in respect of the first decision, must also proceed to a final hearing, the first decision not being one excluded from the operation of s 13 of the ADJR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s263">65 I should add for completeness that the further concluding contention raised by the Authority in any event to the effect that since AusCoast presently broadcasts from premises at Tingalpa which are not the premises specified in the conditions of the 1620 licence, being conduct asserted by the Authority to be 'unlawful and improper', the Court should as a matter of discretion refuse that relief.</sentence>
<sentence id="s264">That subject must be a question for another day, and is irrelevant to the issue of competency per se for the reasons I have already indicated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s265">Doubtless on that further occasion, the applicants would seek to pursue in more detail the circumstances and implications of the conduct of the Authority relating to the variation of the site condition on the 1611 licence to the Bracken Ridge Reservoir transmission site, being a conceivable issue apparently to be raised by the applicants from which I would necessarily withhold from further comment at this interlocutory stage of the proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s266">Whether that subject is in any event a matter for legitimate consideration in the context of the administrative relief sought by the applicants would be a matter for submission at that further hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s267">66 The Authority having failed on what has been analogous to a demurrer to the applicants' cause of action, I see no good reason in principle why the applicants should not have the benefit of an award of costs in their favour of and incidental to the present application.</sentence>
<sentence id="s268">67 The proceedings will be stood over to a date to be fixed by agreement by the parties, or by the Court in the event that no agreement is reached, for the purpose or making such declarations and orders as may be appropriate to give effect to these reasons for judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s269">
 
 I certify that the preceding sixty-seven (67) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Conti.</sentence>

 INTRODUCTION 
 
1 This is an appeal, pursuant to s 44 of the Administration Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) ('the AAT Act'), from a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal constituted by Mr P J Lindsay, Senior Member ('the Tribunal'), given on 18 January 2005.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">2 The Tribunal's decision was recorded in the following terms:
 
 'The tribunal affirms the decision under review in relation to the inclusion of the sum of $1,228,500 in the applicant's assessable income for the year ended 30 June 1988, but in relation to penalty remits the matter to the respondent with the direction that the assessment for that income year be amended by remitting additional tax in full.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">' 
 

3 The Commissioner of Taxation ('the Commissioner') appeals from so much of the Tribunal's decision as remits the matter of additional tax to the Commissioner with the direction that such additional tax be remitted in full.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">4 The Commissioner, in his Amended Notice of Appeal, states that the following questions of law are raised on the appeal ---
 
 
 '1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">Whether the Tribunal exceeded the jurisdiction conferred on it by section 14ZZ of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 [(Cth) ('the Administration Act')] in purporting to direct the Applicant to remit in full additional tax imposed on the Respondent for the year ended 30 June 1988.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">
 
 
 
 
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The proper interpretation of sections 14ZQ and 14ZS of the [Administration Act] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">
 
 
 
 
 
 3.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Whether the Tribunal erred in law in purporting to direct the Applicant to remit additional tax in full.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">' 
 
 
 

5 The grounds of appeal are stated in the same document (at par 4) in the following terms:
 
 
 '4.1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The Tribunal erred in law in failing to hold that the Applicant's decision on objection refusing to remit additional tax imposed pursuant to sec 223 was an "ineligible income tax remission decision" under section 14ZS of the [Administration Act] and therefore not a "reviewable objection decision" for the purposes of section 14ZQ of that Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">
 
 4.2 The Tribunal erred in law in purporting to direct the Applicant to remit the additional tax in full, in circumstances where there was no jurisdiction to do so.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">
 
 
 
 
 
 4.3 The Tribunal should have held that the Applicant's decision refusing to remit the additional tax was not a "reviewable objection decision" within the meaning of section 14ZQ of the [Administration Act] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">
 
 
 
 
 
 4.4 In so far as the Tribunal purported to direct the Applicant to remit additional tax payable under either section 207 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 or Division 1 of Part IIA of the [Administration Act] , the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to make such a direction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">
 
 
 
 
 
 4.5 If, contrary to the grounds set out in paragraphs 4.1 to 4.4 above, the Tribunal did have jurisdiction to direct that additional tax be remitted in full, the Tribunal, in purporting to make such a direction, erred in law in taking into account an irrelevant consideration namely the Applicant's consent to the matter remaining in abeyance before the Tribunal pending finalisation of other proceedings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">' 
 
 
 
 BACKGROUND 
 
6 On 24 June 1994, following an audit, the Commissioner issued the respondent taxpayer with an amended assessment of income tax for the year ended 30 June 1988 including in his assessable income for that year an amount of $1,228,500 received by him in respect of a certain large infrastructure project.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">Additional Tax for incorrect return, shown at label D of the notice of amended assessment, in the sum of $586,858.75, was also imposed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">7 The taxpayer, by his taxation agent, lodged an objection to the amended assessment by letter dated 5 July 1994, but the grounds were confined to the inclusion of the sum of $1,228,500 in his assessable income and did not put in issue the imposition of the additional tax of $586,858.75.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">8 By letter dated 16 February 1996 the Commissioner disallowed the taxpayer's objection for the reason:
 
 'It is considered that the income received from Kumagai Gumi Co Ltd and Transfield Pty Ltd forms part of your assessable income.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">' 
 
 

Not surprisingly, the objection decision made no reference to the imposition of additional tax because it was not raised as a ground of objection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">Indeed, it was not mentioned in the objection at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">9 By letter dated 31 October 2003 solicitors acting for the taxpayer filed a statement of facts, issues and contentions on behalf of the taxpayer, however, the matter of additional tax was not raised as an issue and it certainly formed no part of the taxpayer's contentions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">Not surprisingly, the Commissioner's amended statement of facts, issues and contentions dated 26 October 2004, likewise made no reference to the matter of additional tax.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">10 The first time the matter of additional tax or 'penalty', as it is sometimes referred to, was raised was before the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">How it was raised and why the Tribunal allowed it to be raised is not disclosed in the transcript of proceedings before the Tribunal, nor in the Tribunal's reasons for decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">However, these documents suggest, with respect, that:
 
 (i) Neither counsel for the taxpayer, nor counsel for the Commissioner, nor the Tribunal was aware that the taxpayer had not included any ground in his notice of objection going to the additional tax imposed at label D of the amended notice of assessment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">So much is exemplified in the following extract from p-95 of the transcript of the hearing on the second day (19 November 2004):
 'MR QUINN [Counsel for the Commissioner] : Just briefly on penalty, we say it is a matter --- the Tribunal stands in the shoes of the Commissioner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">We say there wasn't full and true disclosure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">I mean, it couldn't be the case that having regard to the number of taxpayers and the way the Commissioner must administer the Act that not to put at least copies of the agreements, that that was full disclosure.</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">To that extent we say that the amount of penalty is appropriate in the circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">Unless there's anything else ---' 
 
 
 (ii) If counsel for the taxpayer was aware that the taxpayer had not included any ground in his notice of objection going to the additional tax imposed at label D of the amended notice of assessment, no attempt was made, by way of application to the Tribunal, to include the additional tax issue as an additional ground of objection and, even if an application was made, no such order was made by the Tribunal pursuant to s 14ZZK of the Administration Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">On the hearing of the appeal there was an interruptive protestation on the part of counsel for the taxpayer that any such conclusion would be misleading.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">However, it was not taken further (apart from what was said to be anecdotal evidence from the bar table) in the written submissions I afforded counsel for the taxpayer, at his request, further time to make.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">


 
 (iii) The Tribunal seems to have regarded itself as having jurisdiction with respect to not only additional tax imposed at label D of the amended notice of assessment, but also additional tax by way of interest for late payment of tax assessed pursuant to s 207 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) ('the ITAA 36').</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">So much is exemplified in the following extract from p-77 of the transcript of the hearing on the second day:
 
 'MR RAPHAEL: Now, if we might go to the question of penalty.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">
 
 MR LINDSAY: And on that the witness gave evidence, did he --- the applicant gave evidence that the sum assessed has not yet been paid?</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">
 
 MR RAPHAEL: Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">
 
 MR LINDSAY: So there must be quite a large amount of interest that has accrued on this sum, is that --- 
 
 MR RAPHAEL: Yes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">
 
 MR LINDSAY: I'm not privy to all of the --- I haven't read all of the detail, Mr Raphael --- 
 
 MR RAPHAEL: One should not give evidence from the bar table but --- 
 
 MR LINDSAY: No, I know, but you are trying to --- I'm getting some assistance from you, but is interest running from 1987 on this amount?</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">
 
 MR RAPHAEL: So I would tender the report of the Australian Tax Office ...' 
 
 It is also exemplified in the Tribunal's reasons for decision:
 
 
 
 '57.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">Where a taxpayer omits an item of assessable income from their return, s.223(7) deems the taxpayer to have made a statement in their return to the effect that they did not derive that item of income.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">The provision applies in this matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">
 
 
 
 
 
 58.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">... 
 
 
 
 
 
 59.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">I find that there are mitigating circumstances present in this matter that should be taken into account on review in the exercise of the discretion in s.227(3) to remit additional tax: 
 
 
 
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 
 
 60.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">... 
 
 
 
 
 
 61.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">I accept the applicant's submission that this transaction or dealing is one that falls into the clearly arguable category.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">I also accept that his income tax return gave the respondent some information about the transaction and this should be contrasted with the situation where there is a total omission of any reference to the particular transaction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">Having regard to the policy of encouraging accuracy and completeness of returns that is embodied in s.223, but being cognisant also that the discretion has been introduced to mitigate potential harshness resulting from the imposition of penalty under s.223(1) being double the amount of tax avoided, I am satisfied that this is an appropriate case in which to remit the culpability component of the penalty in full.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">In relation to the per annum component, it is relevant to note that the respondent consented to the matter being held in abeyance for a number of years pending the finalisation of proceedings brought by Jones, extending to his appeals to the High Court.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">I consider it appropriate that any per annum component be remitted for the entire period from the date of issue of the amended assessment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">' 
 
 
 

11 While the Tribunal's ultimate decision ([2], supra) in relation to 'penalty' is clearly a reference to additional tax imposed at label D of the amended notice of assessment, it is equally clear, in my view, that what the Tribunal is referring to in the last two sentences of par 61 of its reasons for decision and in the extract from the transcript cited above is the additional tax by way of interest pursuant to s 207 of the ITAA 36 and, if it is, it is clearly beyond the Tribunal's jurisdiction.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">This latter matter was not, however, the subject of the Tribunal's ultimate decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">It follows that ground 4.5 of the Amended Notice of Appeal is misconceived.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">12 I hesitate to suggest this, but it seems to me that the Tribunal's analysis of the 'penalty' issue was a function of the confused thinking inherent in the submissions put to the Tribunal by both counsel below.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">This is further exemplified in the Commissioner's grounds of appeal and in his original written submissions, both having as their focus the construction and application of s 14ZS and, by force of the definitions therein, s 14ZQ of the Administration Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">13 It is s 14ZS, as originally enacted (see Taxation Laws Amendment (No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">3) Act 1991 (Cth)), that applies to objection decisions that relate to the remission of additional tax under s 223 of the ITAA 36.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">As originally enacted, s 14ZS relevantly provided:
 
 
 '(1) For the purposes of this Part, an objection decision is an ineligible income tax remission decision if subsection (2) ... applies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">
 
 
 
 
 
 (2) An objection decision is an ineligible income tax remission decision if it relates to the remission of additional tax payable by a taxpayer under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 other than Division 11 of Part IIIAA , except where the additional tax is payable under Part VII of that Act and its amount, after the decision is made, exceeds: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (a) ... 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) in the case of additional tax payable under section 223 of that Act because of the making of a statement: 
 
 
 
 
 (i) if the statement relates to only one year of income --- the amount calculated, in respect of the period commencing on the day that is the prescribed day in relation to the taxpayer in relation to the year of income and ending on the day on which the assessment of the additional tax is made, at the rate of 20% per year of the amount of the relevant affected tax in relation to the taxpayer in relation to the year of income; or 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (ii) ...' (Emphasis added) 
 
 
 
 

14 Relevantly, s 14ZQ defined 'objection decision' as having the meaning given by subs 14ZY(2), namely, by reference to subs 14ZY(1), a decision of the Commissioner to allow an objection, wholly or in part, or to disallow it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">15 It is difficult to understand the focus of the Commissioner on s 14ZS of the Administration Act in the present case when neither the taxpayer's objection nor, in consequence, the Commissioner's objection decision, referred in any way to the remission of additional tax imposed by the amended notice of assessment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">In support of that focus I was referred to cases which, correctly in my view, hold that the words 'relates to' are wide words signifying some connection between two subject matters --- with the connection or association signified by the words being either direct or indirect, substantial or real.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">However, in the present case, there is absolutely no connection or association between the objection decision and the remission of additional tax payable under s 223 of the ITAA 36.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">It may be, as the Full court of this Court observed in Grollo Nominees Pty Ltd v FC of T (1997) 73 FCR 452 at 523, 
 
 'that it would seem an odd thing if there were ... an appeal to the Tribunal on the question of the amount of income tax payable which did not carry with it the right to question any consequential imposition of additional tax', 
 
 

but this is such a case, in the absence of the Tribunal making an order pursuant to s 14ZZK of the Administration Act allowing the taxpayer to include the additional tax issue as an additional ground of objection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">In short, the objection decision in the present case is not an ineligible income tax remission decision under s 14ZS of the Administration Act and, insofar as the Commissioner's appeal is grounded on this issue, it must fail.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">16 In his written submissions in reply, the Commissioner refocussed his argument, to where it always should have been focussed, on subs 43(1) of the AAT Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">17 Subsection 43(1) of the AAT Act is in the following terms:
 
 'For the purpose of reviewing a decision, the Tribunal may exercise all the powers and discretions that are conferred by any relevant enactment on the person who made the decision and shall make a decision in writing: 
 
 
 
 (a) affirming the decision under review; 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) varying the decision under review; or 
 
 
 
 
 
 (c) setting aside the decision under review and: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (i) making a decision in substitution for the decision so set aside; or 
 
 (ii) remitting the matter for reconsideration in accordance with any directions or recommendations of the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">' 
 
 
 
 

18 The Commissioner submitted that the present appeal was one where the remission of penalty by the Tribunal could not have been for the purpose of reviewing the decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">It was not relevant to the making of the decision because the parameters of that decision had already been set by the taxpayer's objection.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">It could not have been properly raised by the taxpayer before the Tribunal unless and until an order was obtained by the taxpayer under s 14ZZK(a) of the Administration Act which did not occur.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">As such, there could not be 'an association' between the power exercised by the Tribunal and the decision under review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">If an objection had been made to the assessment of penalty and an objection decision had been made in relation to that matter, there may have been (subject to the operation of s 14ZS of the Administration Act) some basis for saying that the exercise of a power to remit by the Tribunal was in the words of Hill J in Secretary, Department of Social Security v Hodgson (1992) 37 FCR 32 'relevant to the making of the decision under review'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">There would be present 'an association' between any exercise of discretion by the Tribunal to remit penalty and the objection decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">19 In my view, this misconceives the matter and puts an impermissible gloss upon s 43.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">20 While the taxpayer did not include in his objection a ground putting in issue the imposition of additional tax; and while the Commissioner's objection decision disallowing the taxpayer's objection did not, in consequence, deal with that issue; and while the taxpayer had no right to agitate the issue before the Tribunal unless the Tribunal otherwise ordered (s 14ZZK(a) of the Administration Act), which the Tribunal did not, nevertheless, in deciding the taxpayer's objection, the Commissioner could have further remitted the additional tax imposed at label D of the notice of amended assessment, pursuant to the discretion vested in him by subs 227(3) of the ITAA 36.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">The fact that he had already exercised this discretion, at the time of assessment to remit the additional tax to $586,858.75 was no bar or impediment to his further remission of the additional tax at the time of making his objection decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">21 If this be right, then it is difficult to see why subs 43(1) of the AAT Act did not give the Tribunal jurisdiction to make that part of the decision against which this appeal is brought, namely, remission of the penalty matter to the Commissioner with the direction that the assessment for the year ended 30 June 1988 be amended by remitting additional tax in full.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">Subsection 43(1) of the AAT Act has been construed as not requiring the power or discretion to be exercised by the Tribunal as being necessarily involved in the making of the decision under review: Secretary, Department of Social Security v Hodgson supra at 39 --- 40.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">In Commonwealth Bank Officers Superannuation Corporation Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCAFC 244 (30 November 2005, unreported) the Full Court of this Court observed at [29] --- [30]:
 
 '...Section 43 empowers the Tribunal to exercise all the powers and discretions conferred upon the original decision-maker, provided it does so for the purpose of reviewing a decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">Provided the necessary purpose is present, the power conferred upon the Tribunal is not otherwise limited.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">It is neither necessary nor permissible to put a gloss upon s 43 that would permit the Tribunal to exercise the discretion maker's powers and discretions only when those powers or discretions are necessarily interdependent with the decision under review, or where the power or discretion to be exercised by the Tribunal is necessarily involved in the making of the decision under review --- see Secretary, Department of Social Security v Hodgson [supra].</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">
 
 Thus, so long as the exercise of powers and discretions by the Tribunal is for the purpose of reviewing a decision, all of the powers and discretions conferred by any relevant enactment on the decision-maker who made the decision, can be exercised by the Tribunal' (Emphasis)
 

22 In making this observation, the Full Court was adopting the views expressed by Hill J in Hodgson .</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">In particular, what his Honour went on to say in that case at 40:
 
 'Of course there must be an association between the power to be exercised by the Tribunal and the decision under review, but that association is to be found in the restriction of the grant of power in s 43(1) to the purpose of the Tribunal's review.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">The test is one of relevance rather than dependence .</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">Where the exercise of a power or discretion is relevant to the making of the decision under review then, if requested, the Tribunal may exercise the discretion.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">' (Emphasis)
 

23 There can be no doubt, in the present case, that the exercise by the Tribunal of the discretion to remit the matter of the additional tax to the Commissioner with a direction that the additional tax be remitted in full is relevant to the making of the objection decision, if not dependent upon it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">In that sense, the Tribunal exercised the discretion for the purpose of reviewing the objection decision and any argument that it did not must be rejected.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">24 For the foregoing reasons, the appeal must be dismissed with costs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">

 (2) In carrying out its functions, the Trust must endeavour to contribute to 
 the enrichment of the cultural, educational, social and economic life of 
 the people of Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">' 
 
 
 17 The powers of the Trust, conferred by s 6 of the VAC Act, are the sorts of powers ordinarily conferred on a statutory corporation, with the addition of some that might be considered unusual for a government body.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">For example, s 6(2) confers on the Trust the following powers: 


 
 '(e) to apply for and hold any licence or permit under the Liquor Control 
 Reform Act 1998 or any other Act; 
 
 (f) to register, purchase or apply for or otherwise acquire either wholly 
 or in part any invention, copyright, trade-mark or other mark or 
 design, patent, patent rights and privileges, licences, concessions or 
 other like rights which in the opinion of the Trust will be of assistance 
 to the Trust in carrying out its functions and to sell, dispose of, use, 
 exercise and develop such rights or inventions or to grant licences or 
 privileges in respect thereof; 
 
 ... 
 
 (h) to install, use, work and maintain film cameras and projectors and 
 broadcasting and television apparatus, and to grant the right of 
 installing, using, working and maintaining the same within the areas 
 under its control upon such terms and conditions and subject to the 
 payment of such charges as may be determined by the Trust; 
 
 (i) to print or reproduce in any manner or form and to publish or to 
 arrange for the printing or reproduction or publishing of plays, music, 
 programmes, posters and advertisements and such other material as 
 the Trust may deem expedient and to acquire the copyright therein; 
 
 (j) to commission plays, compositions, musicals, ballets, operas or other 
 works;' 
 
 
 18 The Trust's borrowing powers, conferred by s 7 of the VAC Act, are confined to borrowing with the approval of the Treasurer and subject to such terms, conditions and limits as the Treasurer imposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">The Treasurer has power, given by s 7(3), to guarantee repayment and the payment of interest, charges and expenses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">


 
 19 By amendment to the VAC Act in 2000, s 14(4) provides that a person employed by the Trust is not, in respect of that employment, subject to the provisions of the Public Sector Management and Employment Act 1998 (Vic).</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">Also by later amendment, ss 3A and 3B of the VAC Act provide that the Trust has vested in it collections of performing arts material and artworks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">By s 18 of the VAC Act, the Trust may not sell or dispose of any item that is part of those collections without advertising its intention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">If any objection is received, the decision whether to sell is one for the Minister, or a delegate of the Minister.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">By amendment of the VAC Act in 1994, s 18A was inserted, to give the Trust power to make by-laws.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">


 
 20 It may be relevant to observe how the Trust sees itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">In its annual report for 2003-2004, the Trust described itself as follows: 


 
 'Purpose and statutory functions 
 
 The core purpose of the Victorian Arts Centre Trust (the Trust) is to enrich the lives of Victorians --- culturally, educationally, socially and economically 
 ( Victorian Arts Centre Act 1979 Section 5 ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">
 
 The Trust's responsibilities include: 
 
 &#8226; to control, manage, operate, promote, develop and maintain the Arts 
 Centre; 
 
 &#8226; to produce and present theatrical performances of any kind; 
 
 &#8226; to promote the use of the Arts Centre by the community; 
 
 &#8226; to ensure the maintenance, conservation, development, promotion 
 and exhibition of the State collection of performing arts materials 
 and the public art collection, as well as making material available 
 for study or loan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">
 
 Our role 
 
 &#8226; providing leadership in the creation, presentation, promotion and 
 advocacy of the performing arts; 
 
 &#8226; stimulating curiosity and understanding of the performing arts; 

 &#8226; increasing accessibility and enjoyment of the performing arts; 

 &#8226; creating partnerships that increase the value and potential of the 
 performing arts; 
 
 &#8226; exercising responsible care and presentation of publicly owned 
 cultural assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">
 
 Our vision 
 
 Our vision is of a society that values the performing arts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">' 
 
 
 21 In two places on its web site, the Trust describes itself as: 


 
 'a statutory authority of the Arts Portfolio.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">The Arts Portfolio is 
 administered by Arts Victoria, a division of the Department of Premier 
 and Cabinet.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">' 
 
 
 22 Further, on its web page, the Trust says: 


 
 'The Arts Centre is the flagship of the performing arts in Victoria, and the focal point of Melbourne's cultural precinct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">The Arts Centre is owned by the people of Victoria, and we welcome people at large to experience all that the Arts Centre has to offer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">
 
 In assocciation [ sic ] with some of Australia's top performing arts companies, and an array of national and international companies, we present a unique diversity of arts and entertainment choices all year round.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">The Arts Centre also offers eating and exhibitions to appeal to every age, taste and budget.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">' 
 
 
 23 The Arts Victoria Act 1972 (Vic) creates the office of Director, Arts Victoria, and provides for the appointment of a body called the Victorian Council of the Arts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">Section 4 of that Act provides, in relation to the Department of Premier and Cabinet: 


 
 'The objects of the Department under this Act are&#8722; 
 
 (a) to develop and improve the knowledge understanding appreciation 
 and practice of the Arts in Victoria; 
 
 (b) to increase the availability and accessibility of the Arts to the public of 
 Victoria; 
 
 (c) to encourage and assist in the provision of facilities to enable the Arts 
 to be performed or displayed; 
 
 (d) to continually survey and assess the position of the Arts in Victoria 
 and to report to the Parliament at least once in every year on the 
 condition of the Arts in Victoria and to suggest ways in which the Arts 
 may be further and better assisted; 
 
 (e) to administer the Acts and enactments for which the Minister is 
 responsible; 
 
 (f) to advise and co-operate with other Departments of the Government 
 public statutory authorities municipalities and other persons or bodies 
 concerned with the promotion or practice of the Arts in Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">' 
 
 
 24 It is clear that the Trust is not a State Government department, for the purposes of the phrase 'State Government Departments and Instrumentalities' in the award clauses with which this case is concerned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">There is a clear contrast between the Trust and Arts Victoria, which is described as a division of what is undoubtedly a State Government department.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">The test for determining whether a particular body is an 'instrumentality' of a State, within the ordinary meaning of that term, is found in Re Anti-Cancer Council of Victoria; Ex parte State Public Services Federation [1992] HCA 53 ; (1992) 175 CLR 442 at 448, where the High Court said: 


 
 'It is well settled that union eligibility rules are to be interpreted liberally and according to their ordinary and popular meaning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">However, the expression "State instrumentality" is one that carries much the same meaning in popular usage as in a legal context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">That meaning directs attention to the purpose or end served, so that a body is a State instrumentality if it is empowered to and does, in fact, serve some State government purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">And that is so even if it is neither a servant nor an agent of the State.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">' [Footnotes omitted]
 
 
 25 Among the authorities cited for the central proposition is the passage in the judgment of Isaacs and Rich JJ in Federated Municipal and Shire Council Employees' Union of Australia v Melbourne Corporation [1919] HCA 72 ; (1919) 26 CLR 508 at 530---531, where their Honours said: 


 
 'If a municipality either (1) is legally empowered to perform and does perform any function whatever for the Crown, or (2) is lawfully empowered to perform and does perform any function which constitutionally is inalienably a Crown function &#8722; as, for instance, the administration of justice &#8722; the municipality is in law presumed to represent the Crown, and the exemption applies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">Otherwise, it is outside that exemption, and, if impliedly exempted at all, some other principle must be resorted to.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">The making and maintenance of streets in the municipality is not within either proposition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">' 
 
 
 26 In the Anti-Cancer Council case, the court held that the Anti-Cancer Council of Victoria ('the ACCV') was not a 'State instrumentality', within the meaning of that expression in a trade union's eligibility rules.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">The ACCV was not under ministerial control.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">Its only function that might have been described as serving a State Government purpose was the receipt of reports and the keeping and compiling of a register, for which the ACCV received a small amount of government funding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">Significantly, there was no obligation imposed on the ACCV with respect to the reports it received or the cancer register.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">The court held that the ACCV fell within another limb of the rule of the trade union in question, which defined those eligible for membership.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">


 
 27 Counsel for the respondent relied on R v Industrial Court of South Australia; Ex parte Australian Broadcasting Commission (1976) 13 SASR 460.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">The Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia held that the Australian Broadcasting Commission ('the ABC') was not an 'instrumentality or agency of the Government of the Commonwealth', within the meaning of s 114 of the Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1972---1975 (SA).</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">At 284, Bray CJ, with whom Hogarth J agreed, referred to Electricity Trust of South Australia v Linterns Ltd [1950] SASR 133, in which it was held that the Electricity Trust of South Australia was a government instrumentality, as it managed the undertaking for the supply of electricity and the mining of coal in South Australia, exercised its functions on behalf of the Crown, and was the means or agency for managing a Crown asset.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">At 284---285, Bray CJ conceded that the ABC might be regarded as an instrumentality of the Commonwealth, but expressed the view that it could not be regarded as an instrumentality of the 'Government' of the Commonwealth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">His Honour took the view that the word 'Government', with a capital initial, in s 114 meant the executive government of the Commonwealth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">At 285, his Honour examined various provisions of the statute creating the ABC, emphasising the degree of autonomy from the executive government enjoyed by the ABC (with ministerial control only over a small number of specified functions, or in some exceptional specified circumstances), and the obligation of the ABC to indemnify the Postmaster-General in respect of any claim for anything done by the Postmaster-General's Department at the request of the ABC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">His Honour also pointed out that there was nothing in the statute declaring that the ABC held its assets on behalf of the Crown.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">At 285---286, Bray CJ also regarded as relevant the question whether the degree of ministerial control was sufficient to entitle the ABC to the shield of the Crown.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">Assuming it to have been decided correctly, the ABC case is readily distinguishable from the present.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">


 
 28 In the present case, one of the most striking features of the Trust is the extent to which it is subject to ministerial control.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">By s 4(2) of the VAC Act, the Trust's management of the Victorian Arts Centre is expressly subject to the general direction and control of the relevant Minister of the Crown.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">The Trust can only perform functions outside those expressly conferred by s 5(1) if the Minister approves of such functions (see s5(1)(h)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">The exercise of the Trust's borrowing power is only possible with the approval of the Treasurer, under s 7.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">The extent of ministerial control is such that the Trust would be very likely to have the benefit of the immunity of the Crown from the application of legislation not expressed to bind the Crown, or from being sued or convicted of a criminal offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">In determining whether a statutory authority has such immunity, the extent to which it is subject to ministerial control under its establishing legislation is of great importance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">See Superannuation Fund Investment Trust v Commissioner of Stamps (SA) [1979] HCA 34 ; (1979) 145 CLR 330 at 347---350 per Stephen J, and State Bank of New South Wales v Commonwealth Savings Bank of Australia [1986] HCA 62 ; (1986) 161 CLR 639 at 650.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">


 
 29 The first function of the Trust, listed in s 5(1) of the VAC Act, is to control, manage, operate, promote, develop and maintain the Victorian Arts Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">The land and buildings comprising the Victorian Arts Centre are vested in the Trust, by virtue of s 2(d) of the VAC Act, and by virtue of the vesting of what was formerly Crown land in the Trust's predecessor, the Building Committee, by the 1956 Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">


 
 30 The legislative history, and the terms of the VAC Act, suggest strongly that the principal purpose for the Trust's existence is to hold the title to, and to manage, a major public asset on behalf of the Crown in right of the State of Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">That this is the purpose of the VAC Act is confirmed by reference to the speech of the Minister for the Arts upon the second reading of the bill that became the VAC Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">In the course of that speech, the Minister said: 


 
 'The Government's investment in the project to date has been substantial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">Its commitment to it has been a strong one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">This Bill provides a means of protecting that investment by establishing an operating style that is flexible, business-like and expressly designed for the needs of a major performing arts centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">The centre is not just a set of buildings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">' 
 
 
 31 This extract from the second reading speech also suggests that the powers to which I have referred in [17], which I have described as unusual for a government body, have been conferred on the Trust as a means of enabling the better performance by the Trust of its principal function.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">The unusual powers enable the Trust to act as an impresario and a promoter, so that it can do all that might be thought necessary to manage effectively the important public asset vested in it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">When viewed in this way, the unusual powers do not detract from the Trust's otherwise clear status as a government instrumentality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">Further, the removal of the employees of the Trust from the area of operation of the Public Sector Management and Employment Act 1998 (Vic), by s 14(4) of the VAC Act, is seen simply as a means of achieving the degree of flexibility thought to be necessary for the Trust to exercise its range of powers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">Again, it should not be thought that such flexibility is necessarily inconsistent with the Trust being a government instrumentality, especially when it is viewed in the light of the ancillary nature of the unusual powers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">


 
 32 Another significant indicator that the Trust is established to serve a government purpose is the grant to it, by s 18A of the VAC Act of the power to make by-laws.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">The delegation of legislative power suggests that the Trust carries on governmental activity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">See State Bank of New South Wales at 651.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">


 
 33 The examination of the legislative history, and of the current state of the VAC Act, makes it difficult to avoid the conclusion that the Trust is both empowered to serve, and does serve a State Government purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">That purpose is the control and management of a significant public asset, which successive governments of Victoria have wished to make available for the economic and cultural enrichment of the citizens of Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">The information on the Trust's web site confirms this view.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">The Trust therefore falls clearly within the ordinary meaning of the phrase 'State instrumentality'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">


 
 34 Counsel for the respondent submitted that the expression 'State Government Departments and Instrumentalities' in cl 8A(a)(ii) of the 1994 Award and cl 15.3.1(b) of the 2003 Award should not bear its ordinary meaning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">His submissions were based on the history of the making of the two awards and the circumstances surrounding them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">He also advanced a number of other arguments about the construction of the relevant provisions, including the argument that a purposive construction of them should be adopted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">
 The history and context of the awards 
 

 
 35 Prior to 1992, terms and conditions of employment in the contract cleaning industry in Victoria were regulated pursuant to Victorian law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">By that time, there were two main awards regulating the contract cleaning industry, the Building Services Award and the Building Services (State Government Departments and Instrumentalities) Award .</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">


 
 36 In or about 1992, the Victorian Government began to contract out the cleaning of government premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">As a consequence, the applicant or one of its predecessor unions applied to the Industrial Relations Commission of Victoria to vary the Building Services (State Government Departments and Instrumentalities) Award .</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">The variation sought was the insertion of a clause that would ensure that the conditions in that Award, which were superior to those in the Building Services Award , would continue to be available to employees cleaning government premises in Victoria, although those employees were employed by contractors and not by the State of Victoria itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">On 21 September 1992, Commissioner Pimm made an order, inserting into the Building Services (State Government Departments and Instrumentalities) Award a new clause, designated as cl 1A Incidence of Award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">So far as is relevant to this proceeding, that clause provided: 


 
 'The Building Services (State Government Departments and Instrumentalities) Award applies to the whole of the State of Victoria for persons engaged in the provision of building services in the occupations of building attendant, caretaker, cleaner, lift attendant or security officer, howsoever designated, employed --- 
 
 (a) By a contractor engaged by a State Government Department or 
 Instrumentality'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">
 
 
 37 On 29 October 1992, when the Industrial Relations Commission of Victoria in full session made a new Building Services (State Government Departments and Instrumentalities) Award , to supersede the former award of that name, this incidence clause appeared in Pt A of that award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">


 
 38 Counsel for the respondent contended that, both before and after the insertion of the incidence of award clause, cleaners at the Victorian Arts Centre were employed by a contractor and were not paid any allowance referable to the Trust being a government instrumentality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">He contended that the purpose of the incidence of award clause was solely to ensure that superior terms and conditions of employment enjoyed by cleaners employed by the State of Victoria continued to apply when the State contracted out the cleaning of its premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">


 
 39 Not long after October 1992, there was a substantial flight from Victorian state awards to federal awards, as unions attempted to avoid new Victorian legislation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">The applicant attempted to obtain a federal award for cleaners.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">Employers in the industry opposed this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">Although the applicant was successful in overcoming an objection that the Commission had no jurisdiction to make an award, the Commission refused to make an interim award sought by the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">On 25 October 1993, a Full Bench of the Commission published a decision following a review of wage fixing principles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">Among the principles it laid down for the making of first federal awards was a principle providing that: 


 
 'In awards regulating the employment of workers previously covered by a State award or determination, existing State award rates and conditions prima facie will be the proper award rates and conditions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">' 
 
 
 40 Following negotiations about the making of a federal award for the contract cleaning industry, the applicant entered into a memorandum of agreement dated 16 March 1994 ('the memorandum of agreement'), with the Australian Building Services Association, the Property Services Council of Australia, the Victorian Employers Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry, the Australian Chamber of Manufactures and Eski Cleaning Services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">That memorandum of agreement provided relevantly as follows: 


 
 'The parties agree: 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">To make a joint application for a Federal Award that preserves rates 
 of pay and allowances as they were prescribed for the contract 
 cleaning industry in the expired awards of the former Industrial 
 Relations Commission of Victoria, known as the Building Services 
 Award, the Building Services (State Government Departments &amp; 
 Instrumentalities) Award, the Miscellaneous Workers Post-Secondary 
 Education (TAFE) Award and the Cleaners and Domestic Arts 
 Assistants (Government Schools) Award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">That the Award made prescribe common conditions of employment 
 for the industry, other than where to prescribe such common 
 conditions of employment would result in a reduction in income 
 contrary to Point 1 of this agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">
 
 It is acknowledged by the parties that the implementation of 1 and 2 
 of this agreement shall be staged as follows: 
 
 (a) An initial application to the Commission for a minimum rates 
 award, the scope and Incidence of that award being in similar 
 terms to the Incidence of the former Building Services Award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">

 (b) A second stage where the paid rates applicable in the former 
 paid rates awards applicable to the cleaning industry are 
 incorporated as separate parts into the Building Services 
 Award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">' 
 
 
 41 On 16 March 1994, a representative of the applicant announced the memorandum of agreement to Deputy President Acton of the Commission, and sought the making of an award in accordance with it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">In the course of his submissions, the applicant's representative told Deputy President Acton: 


 
 'The award that I would be asking that the commission make, arising out of today's proceedings is a minimum rates award, the incidence of which is in similar terms to the incidence of the former Building Services Award of the former Industrial Relations Commission of Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">There will be a second stage in the implementation of this agreement at which time the parties will approach the commission and seek to have the award which we would have made today, amended to incorporate rates of pay which were expressed in the former state awards known as the Building Services State Government Departments and Instrumentalities award, the Miscellaneous Workers Post-secondary Education TAFE Award, and the Cleaners and Domestic Arts Assistance Government Schools Award, and that will be the subject of subsequent application to the commission, and of course there will need to be detailed negotiations between the parties as to the final form of such variations to the award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">' 
 
 
 42 The applicant's representative also told Deputy President Acton that the proposed award reflected the situation as it was when the Building Services Conciliation and Arbitration Board and the Building Services State Government Departments and Instrumentalities Conciliation and Arbitration Board had been restructured by decision of the Industrial Relations Commission of Victoria on 7 March 1991.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">The abolition of those boards by statute in August 1992 led to the introduction into the Building Services (State Government Departments and Instrumentalities) Award of the incidence clause to which I have referred in [36].</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">The Commission made the consent award, which is the 1994 Award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">


 
 43 As had been promised to Deputy President Acton, a further application was made to the Commission to incorporate into the 1994 Award the specific rates derived from several former Victorian awards, including the Building Services (State Government Departments and Instrumentalities) Award .</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">The Commission heard that application on 20 July 1994.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">The application was not opposed by representatives of employers, although two of them expressed concern about differential rates within the industry and foreshadowed discussions with a view to absorbing the specific rates into future general increases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">Commissioner Bacon accepted the submission of the parties and invited them to submit an order for him to make.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">This was the origin of cl 8A of the 1994 Award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">


 
 44 This history might be of some assistance to the respondent's case if there were any evidence that the non-payment of rates specified in the Building Services (State Government Departments and Instrumentalities) Award to those employed as cleaners at the Victorian Arts Centre had ever been the result of a conscious decision not to apply those rates, or an awareness that, for some reason, they were inapplicable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">For present purposes, I am prepared to accept that the construction of an award can be affected by a common understanding of the parties to it about a particular state of affairs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">If such a common understanding existed when the award was made, it should not be departed from when the Court comes to construe the award at a subsequent time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">Care must be taken, however, to distinguish a common understanding from common inadvertence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">If the only reason why the government instrumentality rates were not paid at the Victorian Arts Centre was that neither the union nor the employer adverted to the possibility that there was an obligation to pay them, no common understanding results.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">In order to have an understanding, it is necessary that there be a meeting of minds, a consensus.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">There can be no meeting of minds, no consensus, if no-one has thought about the issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">


 
 45 Such evidence as there is in the present case leads to the conclusion that it is only in recent years that the applicant has realised that there is a possibility that those employed as cleaners at the Victorian Arts Centre have been underpaid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">There were several parties to the memorandum of agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">There is no evidence that any of those parties held a view on the issue at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">In this respect, three significant witnesses gave evidence in this proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">Dimitrios Demos was the Operations Manager of the company that became the contractor for the cleaning of the Victorian Arts Centre from the time the Trust took possession of it in 1981.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">He worked for that company until 1987.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">During that time, he became its State Manager for Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">John Lazzari was the State Manager for Victoria of a predecessor company of the respondent from 1993.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">He had direct responsibility for overseeing the carrying out of the contract to clean the Victorian Arts Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">At the time of the transition from State to federal regulation of terms and conditions of employment in the contract cleaning industry, Mr Lazzari was State President of the Building Services Contractors Association of Australia, which he said was incorrectly described in the memorandum of agreement to which I have referred in [40] as the Property Services Council of Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">In that capacity, he was a signatory of the memorandum of agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">John Grant was on the State Executive of the Building Services Contractors Association of Australia at the time of the transition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">None of these three witnesses gave any evidence suggestive of a common understanding between the applicant or its predecessor and any employer, or employer association involved in the contract cleaning industry, to the effect that the Victorian Arts Centre was not regarded as premises of a State Government instrumentality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">It is clear that no-one adverted to the status of the Trust, and to whether it was a State Government instrumentality for the purposes of either the earlier State award or the 1994 Award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">


 
 46 It is not the case that the applicant has changed its mind and gone back on a common understanding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">It is the case that no common understanding ever existed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">
 Other construction arguments 
 

 
 47 The adoption of a purposive construction of the 1994 Award does not assist the respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">Even if the purpose can be ascertained from the express statements of the subjective intentions of the parties to the process of making the 1994 Award, acceptance that the purpose was to reproduce the situation as it had been in Victoria does not answer the question whether there existed an obligation to pay the government instrumentality rates to those employed as cleaners at the Victorian Arts Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">The stated purpose of the memorandum of agreement was to preserve rates of pay 'as they were prescribed'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">If it could be shown that some provision of the earlier Victorian award excluded those employed to clean the premises of the Trust, the stated purpose of the memorandum of agreement would not be fulfilled if the 1994 Award, which was the result of the agreement expressed in the memorandum of agreement, were to be construed as including the Trust's premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">No such provision existed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">On no view can an examination of cl 8A(a)(ii) of the 1994 Award, by itself or in the context of other provisions of the 1994 Award, yield a purpose as specific as the exclusion of the Trust from the concept of a State Government instrumentality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">The purpose was to provide higher rates of pay for those employed in cleaning in the premises of 'State Government Departments and Instrumentalities'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">The question remains whether that concept includes or excludes the Trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">


 
 48 Counsel for the respondent also attempted to argue that the phrase 'State Government Departments and Instrumentalities' had become a term of art in relation to industrial instruments operating in Victoria by the time the 1994 Award was made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">To establish this proposition, he tendered a copy of the original print of the Metal Industry (Victorian Government Departments and Instrumentalities) Interim Award 1981 ('the Metal Industry Award'), dated 14 October 1981.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">Clause 2 of the Metal Industry Award provided: 


 '2 --- PARTIES BOUND

 49 Just how the making of the Metal Industry Award could operate to create a term of art for industrial instruments is unclear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">The organisations that later amalgamated to form the applicant were not parties to the Metal Industry Award, and therefore played no part in the choice of bodies named.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">Mr Lazzari, who was a signatory to the memorandum of agreement referred to in [40], gave evidence that he was not aware of the list in the Metal Industry Award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">It is unlikely that the concept of a State Government department or instrumentality could be frozen in time by a specific listing in one award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">In any event, the list included 'Her Majesty the Queen In Right of the State of Victoria', an entity apt to include all statutory bodies entitled to the immunity of the Crown in right of the State of Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">On the basis that the Trust is such a body, it would be comprehended by the list in the Metal Award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">


 
 50 Although three witnesses with long experience of the contract cleaning industry gave evidence on behalf of the respondent, no witness gave evidence to the effect that the phrase 'State Government Departments and Instrumentalities' had become a term of art in the industry, whether as a result of the Metal Industry Award or otherwise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">


 
 51 Counsel for the respondent attempted to rely on the capitalisation of the initial letter of the word 'Instrumentalities' in each of cl 8A(a)(ii) of the 1994 Award and cl 15.3.1(b) of the 2003 Award, as well as in the earlier Victorian award, as indicative that a particular meaning of the word had been intended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">Capitalisation of the initial letters of words in headings is a common practice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">Inappropriate capitalisation of the initial letters of words, when not used in headings, is also common.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">It is unlikely to indicate the use of a term of art.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">In any event, if a conscious decision had been made to use the word 'Instrumentalities' as a term of art, the option of defining it in the award was available.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">It is unlikely that whoever drafted the 1994 Award made a conscious decision to use a term of art, and to indicate that a term of art had been used solely by the use of an initial capital letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">I do not accept that the fact that the word 'Instrumentality' has a capital initial in the 1994 Award and the earlier Victorian award that replaced it can be said to be indicative of a term of art.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">This is so, even when the word is contrasted with the word 'instrumentality' in the clause considered by the High Court in the Anti-Cancer Council case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">


 
 52 Counsel for the respondent also attempted to argue that I should have regard to possible anomalies that might arise from the application of cl 8A(a)(ii) of the 1994 Award and cl 15.3.1(b) of the 2003 Award to high-rise buildings, occupied by a mix of tenants, only some of which were State Government entities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">This argument is completely irrelevant to the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">There is no suggestion that the Victorian Arts Centre is occupied by any entity other than the Trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">The question of multiple occupancy of buildings and the application of cl 8A(a)(ii) of the 1994 Award is dealt with in Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Union v Prestige Property Services Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 408 , a judgment delivered subsequent to the hearing of the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">


 
 53 For these reasons, I am persuaded that the word 'Instrumentalities' when used in the composite phrase 'State Government Departments and Instrumentalities' in cl 8A(a)(ii) of the 1994 Award and cl 15.3.1(b) of the 2003 Award is used in its ordinary and natural meaning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">When so used, as I have already found, it encompasses the Trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">
 Conclusion and orders 
 

 
 54 It follows that the respondent has been in breach of its obligations, imposed by cl 8A(a)(ii) of the 1994 Award and cl 15.3.1(b) of the 2003 Award, to pay the allowances required by those clauses to its employees engaged in performing cleaning services at the Victorian Arts Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">


 
 55 Section 178(2) of the WR Act provides that multiple breaches of a term of an award, arising out of a course of conduct, are to be treated as a single breach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">Counsel for the applicant accepted that all breaches of the 1994 Award were to be treated as a single breach and all breaches of the 2003 Award were to be treated as another single breach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">This involves the concession that each of the relevant clauses contains a single 'term', for the purposes of s 178 of the WR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">I am prepared to accept this concession in the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">


 
 56 The maximum penalty applicable is $10 000 for each breach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">There has been an increase in the maximum amount, by amendment to the WR Act since the proceeding was commenced, but counsel for the applicant conceded that the earlier maximum is the appropriate one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">In fixing the appropriate penalty, I bear in mind that the real penalty for the respondent will be the necessity to make the payments of underpaid entitlements, together with interest, to each of the employees underpaid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">This will be an expensive exercise for the respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">It will have an effect on the profitability of the contract under which the respondent is responsible for the cleaning of the Victorian Arts Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">I accept that that contract was negotiated without regard to the need to pay the allowances specified by the 1994 Award and the 2003 Award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">Some reference was made to the possibility of renegotiating the contract in light of the outcome of this proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">Whether that can be done, and the Trust can be induced to pay a greater sum in respect of work already done, I do not know.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">I also accept that, at least until recent times, the breaches have arisen from inadvertence, and not from a deliberate intention to underpay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">No suggestion was made that the respondent had a record of prior breaches of awards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">The only aggravating factor appears to be the want of any contrition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">In his evidence, Mr Lazzari was very dismissive of the claim, describing it as 'frivolous'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">Obviously, there was a need for the respondent to look more closely at its obligations, when the issue was first raised by the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">


 
 57 It is also necessary to acknowledge the need for deterrence in an industry in which Mr Grant, who has held several offices in the Building Services Contractors Association over a long period, acknowledged that there is some non-compliance with awards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">


 
 58 Taking all these factors into account, it is appropriate to fix the penalty at $2000 in respect of the breach of the term of the 1994 Award and $1500 in respect of the breach of the term of the 2003 Award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">The usual order is that a penalty be paid to the party seeking its imposition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">There was no submission that such an order would be inappropriate in the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">Pursuant to s 356 of the WR Act, there will be an order that each penalty be paid to the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">


 
 59 I also propose to make an order that the respondent pay to each of the persons it employed at the Victorian Arts Centre the amount agreed to be outstanding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">To each amount there should be added interest, pursuant to s 179A of the WR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">In this respect, the applicant's claim is modest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">Because of the difficulty of calculation of interest when it is payable on a series of payments that were due over a long period, the applicant has asked for interest only from 1 June 2003, ie.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">on the total sum owed to each employee in respect of the two periods claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">The applicant calculated that interest only up to the date when the case was being heard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">It should be calculated to the date of judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">As to the rate, the applicant sought interest at 11 per cent per annum, that being the operative rate at 1 June 2003, pursuant to the Penalty Interest Rate Act 1983 (Vic).</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">It is appropriate to choose that rate for the reasons advanced in EMCL Pty Ltd v Esanda Finance Corporation Ltd (No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">2) (1998) 160 ALR 382 at 384, and Textile, Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia v Givoni Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 1406 at [91] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s255">The rate of interest was increased to 11.25 per cent from 26 June 2003, and to 12 per cent from 1 July 2004, but counsel for the applicant forwent any entitlement to a rate greater than 11 per cent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s256">The order that I make for payment to each employee will therefore include an amount of interest on the sum owing to that employee at 1 June 2003, at the rate of 11 per cent per annum (non-compounding), from 1 June 2003 to the date of judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s257">


 
 60 The case is covered by s 347 of the WR Act, so no question of cost arises.</sentence>
